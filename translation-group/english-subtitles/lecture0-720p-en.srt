00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,910
中文字幕
This is CS50, Harvard University's introduction

2
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,310
中文字幕
to the intellectual enterprises of computer science

3
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,810
中文字幕
and the art of programming.

4
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,480
中文字幕
My name is David Malan, and if you are among those

5
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,300
中文字幕
in the room who are thinking, why am I in a class of computer science,

6
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,750
中文字幕
realize that I too felt that exact same way.

7
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,460
中文字幕
In fact, my freshman year, I didn't quite

8
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,820
中文字幕
get up the nerve to take this class or computer science more generally,

9
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,530
中文字幕
and that was largely because I was intimidated by it.

10
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,680
中文字幕
I was a little nervous.

11
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,590
中文字幕
It felt well out of my comfort zone.

12
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,860
中文字幕
And I really didn't know at the end of the day what it actually was.

13
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,280
中文字幕
But realize if you, too, are feeling a little bit of that,

14
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,140
中文字幕
or even if you're among those more comfortable who

15
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,270
中文字幕
have dabbled in computer science or programming,

16
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,180
中文字幕
realize that there's so many blanks that we can fill in along the way

17
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,510
中文字幕
so that ultimately, at the end of the semester, everyone

18
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,280
中文字幕
will feel themselves on the same page.

19
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,870
中文字幕
And until then, rest assured that 68% of the people sitting to your left

20
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,940
中文字幕
and to your right and behind and in front

21
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:45,230
中文字幕
have never taken a CS course before, which may very well be

22
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,000
中文字幕
the demographic into which you fit.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,330
中文字幕
But realize, too, that with such an amazing support

24
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,820
中文字幕
structure with so many office hours and sections and materials and beyond,

25
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,120
中文字幕
realize that what's ultimately important in this course

26
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,180
中文字幕
is not so much where you end up relative to your classmates

27
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,530
中文字幕
in week 10, our final week, but where you end up relative to yourself

28
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,400
中文字幕
in week zero.

29
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,050
中文字幕
And indeed, that is where we now are.

30
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,810
中文字幕
And as it turns out, computer scientists start counting at zero.

31
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,690
中文字幕
And so over the next 11 weeks, we will take you

32
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,060
中文字幕
from being among those less comfortable or perhaps

33
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,120
中文字幕
somewhere in between less comfortable and more

34
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,510
中文字幕
to feeling much more comfortable and confident and capable than that.

35
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,990
中文字幕
But to get there, we need to understand what computer science really is.

36
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,870
中文字幕
And this was something I didn't understand until I set foot in a room

37
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,530
中文字幕
like this.

38
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,160
中文字幕
And I dare say we can distill computer science into just this picture.

39
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,290
中文字幕
Computer science is about problem solving.

40
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,440
中文字幕
And I know that high school courses typically do kind of paint

41
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,270
中文字幕
a misleading picture that it's only about

42
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,910
中文字幕
and it's entirely about programming and people with their heads

43
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,270
中文字幕
down in the computer lab working fairly anti-socially on code,

44
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,270
中文字幕
but the reality is it's all about solving problems, and very often,

45
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:51,140
中文字幕
solving problems collaboratively either in person or by leveraging code,

46
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,240
中文字幕
programs that others have written in the past.

47
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,980
中文字幕
And what does it mean to solve a problem?

48
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,440
中文字幕
Well, you need inputs.

49
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,280
中文字幕
So there's a problem you're trying to solve.

50
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,150
中文字幕
That is the input.

51
00:02:59,150 --> 00:02:59,990
中文字幕
And you want output.

52
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,800
中文字幕
You want the solution to that problem.

53
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,830
中文字幕
And the sort of secret sauce of computer science

54
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,140
中文字幕
is going to be everything in this proverbial black box

55
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,440
中文字幕
in the middle over the next several weeks,

56
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,090
中文字幕
where you begin to understand exactly what you can do with that.

57
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,050
中文字幕
But in order to start solving problems, we kind of just

58
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,290
中文字幕
need to decide as a group how we're going to represent these problems

59
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,780
中文字幕
and what might a problem be.

60
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,350
中文字幕
Well, in this room, there's a whole bunch of people.

61
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,650
中文字幕
If we wanted to take attendance or count the number of people in this room,

62
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,040
中文字幕
I might need to start keeping track of how many people I see.

63
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,700
中文字幕
But how do I represent the number of people I see?

64
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,070
中文字幕
Well, I can do it sort of old school and I can just take out a piece of chalk

65
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,320
中文字幕
or whatnot and say, all right.

66
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,260
中文字幕
I see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

67
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,220
中文字幕
I can do little stylistic conventions like that

68
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,290
中文字幕
to save space and remind myself.

69
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,840
中文字幕
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and so forth.

70
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,860
中文字幕
Or I can, of course, just do that on my own hand.

71
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,730
中文字幕
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so forth.

72
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,350
中文字幕
But obviously, how high can I count on just one hand?

73
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,110
中文字幕
So 5 you would think, but that's just because we haven't really

74
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,760
中文字幕
thought hard enough about this problem.

75
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,850
中文字幕
It turns out that with just these five fingers, let alone these five more,

76
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,360
中文字幕
I can actually count rather higher because after all, the system

77
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,310
中文字幕
I'm using of hashmarks on the board or just

78
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,550
中文字幕
now with my fingers is just kind of keeping my fingers down and putting

79
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,190
中文字幕
them up to represent ones, really.

80
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,160
中文字幕
But what if I actually took into account the order of my fingers

81
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,860
中文字幕
and sort of permuted them, so to speak, so that it's really patterns of fingers

82
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,860
中文字幕
that represent the number of people in the room,

83
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,660
中文字幕
and not just the mere presence of a finger going up or down.

84
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,480
中文字幕
In other words, this can remain zero.

85
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,130
中文字幕
This could still be one.

86
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,250
中文字幕
But what if two is not just this, the obvious?

87
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,140
中文字幕
But what if it's just this?

88
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,660
中文字幕
So raising just one, my second finger.

89
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,180
中文字幕
What if, then, three is this?

90
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,420
中文字幕
So we have 0, 1, 2, 3.

91
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,150
中文字幕
That's going to lead us to four somewhat offensively.

92
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,140
中文字幕
But if we begin to jump ahead to five, I might now

93
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,790
中文字幕
permute this finger and this finger up.

94
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:56,120
中文字幕
And if I want to now represent six, I could do this.

95
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,910
中文字幕
And now seven.

96
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,870
中文字幕
In other words, I've expressed so many more patterns on my hand already

97
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,910
中文字幕
and if we keep doing this, I think I can actually

98
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:06,740
中文字幕
represent painfully perhaps like 32 different patterns, and therefore

99
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,380
中文字幕
32 different people, on my hands alone.

100
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,690
中文字幕
Or 31 people if I start counting at zero.

101
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,750
中文字幕
So what is that-- what's the relationship

102
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,960
中文字幕
and how did we even get here?

103
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,810
中文字幕
Well, it turns out that computers are kind of simplistic,

104
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,400
中文字幕
much like our hands here.

105
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,940
中文字幕
At the end of the day, your computer is plugged into the wall

106
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,980
中文字幕
or it's got a battery, so it either has or it does not have electricity.

107
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,140
中文字幕
At the end of the day, that is the physical resource

108
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,030
中文字幕
that drives these things and our phones and all of technology today.

109
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,650
中文字幕
So if there is either electricity or not, that kind of maps nicely

110
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,810
中文字幕
to no finger or yes finger.

111
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:39,350
中文字幕
And indeed, computers, as you probably know, only speak what language?

112
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,980
中文字幕
What alphabet, so to speak?

113
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,480
中文字幕
Yeah.

114
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:41,990
中文字幕
Binary.

115
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,890
中文字幕
Bi meaning two.

116
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:46,160
中文字幕
And indeed, that refers to the fact that in binary in computers,

117
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,050
中文字幕
you only have two digits--

118
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,200
中文字幕
zero and one.

119
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,440
中文字幕
We humans, of course, have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,

120
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,570
中文字幕
and then we can combine those to count even higher.

121
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,950
中文字幕
But computers only have 0, 1, and then that's it.

122
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,910
中文字幕
Because at the end of the day, there's actually

123
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,290
中文字幕
a direct mapping between power being off and it being a zero or power being on

124
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,770
中文字幕
and it being one, or some electrons or whatever flowing from your battery

125
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,980
中文字幕
or from the wall.

126
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,240
中文字幕
So this is why computers tend to speak only binary,

127
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,760
中文字幕
because at the end of the day, it just maps really cleanly

128
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,360
中文字幕
to what it is that's powering them in the first place.

129
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,920
中文字幕
But how is this actually useful?

130
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,280
中文字幕
If computers only have zeros and ones, how can they do anything useful?

131
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,030
中文字幕
Well, think about our human world, where you might have this pattern of symbols.

132
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,050
中文字幕
This is decimal, dec meaning 10 because you have 0 through 9.

133
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,270
中文字幕
And this is, of course, 123.

134
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,960
中文字幕
But why?

135
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,330
中文字幕
If you haven't thought about this in quite some time,

136
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,200
中文字幕
this is really just a pattern of three symbols, one and two and three shapes,

137
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,520
中文字幕
or glyphs, on the screen.

138
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,850
中文字幕
But we humans, ever since grade school, have started ascribing meaning

139
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,310
中文字幕
to each of these numbers, right?

140
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,710
中文字幕
If you think back, this is the ones column, this is the tens column,

141
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:53,300
中文字幕
this is the hundreds column, and so forth, and we could keep going.

142
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,450
中文字幕
And so why does this pattern-- one, two, three-- mean 123?

143
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,620
中文字幕
Well, it's because all of us sort of intuitively

144
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,860
中文字幕
nowadays are just quickly in our head doing 100 times 1 plus 10 times

145
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:11,430
中文字幕
2 plus 1 times 3, which of course gives us 100 plus 20 plus three,

146
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,210
中文字幕
and then the number we know mathematically as 123.

147
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,510
中文字幕
But we're all doing this so quickly, you don't really think about this anymore.

148
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,040
中文字幕
Well, computers work fundamentally the same way.

149
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,410
中文字幕
They don't have as many digits--

150
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,030
中文字幕
0 through 9-- as we do.

151
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,080
中文字幕
They only have zeros and ones.

152
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,290
中文字幕
And so if they were to store values, you're

153
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,790
中文字幕
only going to see zeros and ones on the screen,

154
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,950
中文字幕
but those zeros and ones just mean different things.

155
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,530
中文字幕
Instead of having a ones place, tens, a hundreds,

156
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:39,210
中文字幕
they're going to have a ones place, a twos place, a fours place,

157
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,410
中文字幕
and then eights and 16 and beyond.

158
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,060
中文字幕
Now, why?

159
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,250
中文字幕
Well, one and 10 and 100, turns out those are powers of 10.

160
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,580
中文字幕
10 to the 0 is technically 1.

161
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,340
中文字幕
10 to the 1 is just 10.

162
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,750
中文字幕
10 to the 2 is 100.

163
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,140
中文字幕
And that's why you have ones, tens hundreds, thousands, and so forth.

164
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,720
中文字幕
Computers are apparently using powers of 2.

165
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,440
中文字幕
Not surprising.

166
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,580
中文字幕
Binary-- two.

167
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:04,410
中文字幕
So if you only have ones, twos, and fours as your placeholders,

168
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,190
中文字幕
if a computer were storing these digits--

169
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:12,990
中文字幕
0, 0, 0-- that computer is presumably storing what number so far as we

170
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,680
中文字幕
humans understand it?

171
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,560
中文字幕
Well, that's how a computer would store zero.

172
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,800
中文字幕
If a computer is storing literally 0, 0, 0, just

173
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,590
中文字幕
like in our human world, that also is 0, but that's technically

174
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,940
中文字幕
because it's 4 times 0 plus 2 times 0 plus 1 times zero, which is obviously

175
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,600
中文字幕
zero.

176
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,870
中文字幕
Meanwhile, if a computer is actually storing not just,

177
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:35,790
中文字幕
say, 0, 0, 0, but instead is storing this value in binary,

178
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,190
中文字幕
what does that map to in decimal?

179
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,120
中文字幕
So that's one.

180
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:46,640
中文字幕
And now, why, if we change this 0 and 1 to this value here, is this two?

181
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,030
中文字幕
Well, mathematically, for the exact same reasons.

182
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:52,290
中文字幕
And so earlier, I had five fingers, but if you consider just my first three,

183
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,310
中文字幕
when I did this holding up one finger, I was representing two.

184
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,550
中文字幕
And if I want to represent three, recall that I put up the second finger.

185
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,760
中文字幕
And so the reason that could nicely represent three

186
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,110
中文字幕
is because all I was doing with my human hand was counting in binary.

187
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,160
中文字幕
And I could keep counting more and more and more.

188
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,110
中文字幕
And so if I have five fingers or five bits, bit meaning binary digits,

189
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,200
中文字幕
I could count up, it turns out, if we do the math,

190
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,200
中文字幕
as high as 31 by starting to zero.

191
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,530
中文字幕
It's going to be hard to physically do that, but we could.

192
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,280
中文字幕
So why is this useful?

193
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,150
中文字幕
At the end of the day, a computer, therefore,

194
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:30,750
中文字幕
can represent any number of values from 0 to 1 to 2 to 3 to some number much,

195
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,910
中文字幕
much, much higher than that.

196
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,740
中文字幕
All it needs is enough bits, enough zeros and ones.

197
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,940
中文字幕
Well, what are those bits?

198
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,050
中文字幕
Well, all of us have these days in our phones sources of light, for instance.

199
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,050
中文字幕
So I could actually say that this physical device right now--

200
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,490
中文字幕
might be a little hard to tell--

201
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,440
中文字幕
it does have a flashlight and it's technically off at the moment.

202
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,200
中文字幕
But if I turn this flashlight on, thereby using some of the electricity,

203
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,860
中文字幕
now, I'm storing a one.

204
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,940
中文字幕
And so the phone is on.

205
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,870
中文字幕
Now, it's off.

206
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,620
中文字幕
Now, it's on.

207
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,600
中文字幕
And if I see--

208
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,270
中文字幕
can I borrow someone's phone real quick?

209
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,140
中文字幕
May I?

210
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,640
中文字幕
OK.

211
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,700
中文字幕
And flashlight.

212
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,560
中文字幕
How do I turn on the flashlight?

213
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,060
中文字幕
Oh.

214
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,560
中文字幕
Shake it.

215
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,560
中文字幕
That's OK.

216
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,060
中文字幕
OK.

217
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,340
中文字幕
Thank you.

218
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:09,840
中文字幕
Oh.

219
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,260
中文字幕
Thank you.

220
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:10,710
中文字幕
OK.

221
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,410
中文字幕
So this is great.

222
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,560
中文字幕
Now, I can count higher.

223
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,790
中文字幕
Now, this represents the number what if I have two light bulbs or two switches

224
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,180
中文字幕
on at the moment?

225
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:19,680
中文字幕
Yeah.

226
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,170
中文字幕
Three.

227
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,050
中文字幕
Because I have a one, I have a one, and I

228
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,150
中文字幕
have two, which of course is going to end up equaling three.

229
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,090
中文字幕
And if I pick up a third phone somehow, I could count even higher.

230
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,570
中文字幕
Technically, if I had three light bulbs on--

231
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,350
中文字幕
one, one, one-- what would that value be?

232
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:32,850
中文字幕
Seven.

233
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,010
中文字幕
Because it's a four plus a two plus a one, and so forth.

234
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,020
中文字幕
Thank you so much for the spontaneity.

235
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:42,780
中文字幕
So why does this not lead to limitations for us?

236
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,120
中文字幕
I can count in decimal as high as I want.

237
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,540
中文字幕
I can now count in binary as high as I want, so long as I have enough bits.

238
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,310
中文字幕
But how do I actually represent other information?

239
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:57,250
中文字幕
Well, if I want to represent something like a letter, how do I get there?

240
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,540
中文字幕
If computers only have electricity in them and they use binary to count,

241
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,300
中文字幕
and yet somehow they're much more useful than just doing math--

242
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,050
中文字幕
they can have text messages and e-mails and websites and videos and more--

243
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,140
中文字幕
how do we get from zeros and ones to letters?

244
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,400
中文字幕
Well, we-- yeah.

245
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,620
中文字幕
Sorry.

246
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,140
中文字幕
A little louder.

247
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:18,650
中文字幕
Yeah.

248
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,630
中文字幕
We just need to kind of relate the numbers to letters.

249
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,510
中文字幕
In other words, all the people in this room just need to decide at some point

250
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,410
中文字幕
that, you know what?

251
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,200
中文字幕
If we want to represent something like the capital letter A,

252
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,180
中文字幕
we just need to decide on a pattern of bits,

253
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,730
中文字幕
a pattern of fingers, that's going to represent A.

254
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,670
中文字幕
And it turns out humans years ago just unilaterally

255
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:39,840
中文字幕
decided 65 shall be the decimal number that represents capital letter A.

256
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,700
中文字幕
And you might guess capital B is represented by what decimal number?

257
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,420
中文字幕
66.

258
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,500
中文字幕
And then C is 67 and so forth.

259
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,630
中文字幕
And there's a mapping of like 128 or even 256 possible values

260
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,880
中文字幕
for all the keys you might see on a typical keyboard

261
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,680
中文字幕
in order to represent letters.

262
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,260
中文字幕
Now, how does a computer distinguish, though, numbers from letters?

263
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,680
中文字幕
Well, just depends on the context.

264
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,880
中文字幕
If you're using like a calculator program on your Mac

265
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,600
中文字幕
or PC or iPhone or Android, well, the computer, the device,

266
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,050
中文字幕
is just going to know contextually, let me interpret this pattern of zeros

267
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,330
中文字幕
and ones as actual numbers to do math.

268
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,880
中文字幕
But if you're using the SMS app or the messages app on your phone,

269
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,060
中文字幕
you're going to actually be in the context of text,

270
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,380
中文字幕
and so your phone is going to interpret that same pattern of zeros and ones,

271
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,780
中文字幕
or light bulbs being off, or, at the end of the day, transistors,

272
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:27,450
中文字幕
tiny pieces of hardware and computers that are either on or off--

273
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,470
中文字幕
it's going to interpret those patterns as just representing a letter.

274
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,220
中文字幕
If you're in the context of a text messaging application or Microsoft Word

275
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,180
中文字幕
or Google Docs or the like, it completely depends on context.

276
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,780
中文字幕
The system we humans came up with just called ASCII, American Standard Code

277
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,100
中文字幕
for Information Interchange.

278
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,760
中文字幕
The name isn't interesting, but the fact that we all agreed years ago

279
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,210
中文字幕
that 65 is A and so forth is what's important.

280
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,800
中文字幕
And so for instance, if we look at this mapping here

281
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,340
中文字幕
of just the first few letters, what does this mean?

282
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,920
中文字幕
If I were to now get a text message and I had the ability somehow

283
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,190
中文字幕
to look underneath the hood, so to speak, at the pattern of zeros and ones

284
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,890
中文字幕
that someone had just texted me, and that pattern,

285
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:12,230
中文字幕
if I convert it to decimal, technically said, let's say, 72 and 73--

286
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,970
中文字幕
so I get a whole bunch of zeros and ones.

287
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,480
中文字幕
I do some math and I realize, OK, I just received 72 and 73,

288
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,690
中文字幕
but this is texting, and so it's not just numbers my friend is sending me.

289
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:21,690
中文字幕
It's a message.

290
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:27,840
中文字幕
What message did my friend likely send me if he or she sent 72 and then 73?

291
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,370
中文字幕
Yeah.

292
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:28,860
中文字幕
Hi.

293
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,280
中文字幕
H-I. Because if you skim ahead at the right there,

294
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:36,720
中文字幕
that just happens to be in ASCII the mapping between 72 and 73, H and I.

295
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,240
中文字幕
If technically, the message had a third byte, if you will.

296
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,090
中文字幕
A byte, if you've ever wondered, is just eight bits.

297
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,260
中文字幕
It's convenient to talk not in terms of single bits,

298
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,440
中文字幕
where you can't count very high, but with a byte, or eight bits,

299
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,700
中文字幕
you can count higher.

300
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,600
中文字幕
And so it turns out if I received a third byte, another sequence of eight

301
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,520
中文字幕
zeros and ones together--

302
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,150
中文字幕
33.

303
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:59,490
中文字幕
How would we know what this message now is?

304
00:13:59,490 --> 00:13:59,990
中文字幕
Yeah.

305
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,640
中文字幕
So it turns out you would not know this other

306
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,430
中文字幕
than by guessing or Googling or just coming in with this knowledge.

307
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,360
中文字幕
This is now "HI!"

308
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,020
中文字幕
with an exclamation point because 33 just so happens, if you look it up,

309
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,180
中文字幕
to map to an exclamation point, as well.

310
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,360
中文字幕
Now, if we actually looked at the binary of this,

311
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,610
中文字幕
you would actually see this pattern of zeros and ones.

312
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,920
中文字幕
This is how you represent 72 in binary.

313
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,690
中文字幕
This is you represent 73.

314
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,820
中文字幕
And this is how you represent 33.

315
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,810
中文字幕
And notice I've only used one, two, three, four, five, six bits,

316
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:30,200
中文字幕
even though I technically tend to receive things in units of 8,

317
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,220
中文字幕
units of bytes.

318
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:37,770
中文字幕
But why did I not bother writing another 00 here and another 0 here?

319
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,660
中文字幕
Does it matter when you write these things out?

320
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,160
中文字幕
No.

321
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,670
中文字幕
Not really.

322
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:46,010
中文字幕
Like in English, in our human world, if you were to write one, two, three,

323
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,280
中文字幕
that's 123.

324
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,850
中文字幕
If you were to write 0, 1, 2, 3, that's still 123.

325
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,670
中文字幕
So even though we tend to get them in clusters of 8,

326
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,660
中文字幕
we don't necessarily need to write those when just talking about them.

327
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,540
中文字幕
So what have we done?

328
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,160
中文字幕
Well, let me introduce a fancier word now known as abstraction.

329
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,480
中文字幕
Abstraction is just a term generally used in computer science and we'll soon

330
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,530
中文字幕
see in programming for taking some low level-- like literally low level--

331
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:11,700
中文字幕
implementation details, like minutiae even, and understanding them

332
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,450
中文字幕
at some point, but then deciding this is not a useful level conceptually

333
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,750
中文字幕
to think about problems.

334
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,280
中文字幕
I really don't want to solve problems in this world of thinking in 0's and 1's.

335
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,910
中文字幕
I'd much rather think about things minimally in decimal, or better yet,

336
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,640
中文字幕
in the context of letters if I'm actually receiving text, or even

337
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,110
中文字幕
some other representation.

338
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:32,040
中文字幕
So abstraction is about taking fairly low level details

339
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,980
中文字幕
and just simplifying them so that we can have a more useful conversation

340
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,300
中文字幕
and never again worry about where the electricity is coming from.

341
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,730
中文字幕
We can just stipulate my computer can represent zeros and ones.

342
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,230
中文字幕
Therefore, it can represent numbers.

343
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:47,010
中文字幕
Therefore, it can also represent ASCII or letters.

344
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:50,850
中文字幕
And we can kind of move on and start solving more interesting problems.

345
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:56,700
中文字幕
But it would seem that we can't solve all problems because on my keyboard

346
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,300
中文字幕
here, this American keyboard here, there's a whole bunch of symbols,

347
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,810
中文字幕
like a 100 or 200 maybe in total if we actually hit shift and option and all

348
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:04,560
中文字幕
of that.

349
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,170
中文字幕
But what you don't see are some pretty common characters.

350
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,010
中文字幕
Especially in a very international audience,

351
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,490
中文字幕
what can I apparently not even type on this keyboard?

352
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,410
中文字幕
What kinds of symbols?

353
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,000
中文字幕
Yeah.

354
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,190
中文字幕
Anything with an accent.

355
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,240
中文字幕
If you have accents over vowels or other letters.

356
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,740
中文字幕
What else?

357
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,810
中文字幕
I'm sorry.

358
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,560
中文字幕
Umlauts or other characters above letters.

359
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,060
中文字幕
Yeah.

360
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,170
中文字幕
Like pound symbol?

361
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:26,670
中文字幕
Oh.

362
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,710
中文字幕
Like the UK pound symbol.

363
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,210
中文字幕
Sure.

364
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,340
中文字幕
And other countries, too.

365
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,790
中文字幕
Any number of Asian languages.

366
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,410
中文字幕
There's so many symbols that are not depicted on this keyboard,

367
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,630
中文字幕
and yet somehow, all of us with international keyboards or phones

368
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,410
中文字幕
can surely express themselves.

369
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:42,180
中文字幕
But that's because phones and computers these days don't just use ASCII.

370
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,030
中文字幕
ASCII literally used just eight bits total.

371
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,290
中文字幕
Technically seven, but then, ultimately, really eight.

372
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,380
中文字幕
And with eight bits, if you actually do the math--

373
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,750
中文字幕
if you have eight bits or eight fingers, you

374
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:56,130
中文字幕
can only permute them in 256 total possible ways, which

375
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:01,620
中文字幕
is to say that you can only represent 256 characters using ASCII with numbers

376
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,930
中文字幕
underneath the hood, and that's not enough to represent

377
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,220
中文字幕
so many different symbols like those enumerated here.

378
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,850
中文字幕
You can't represent any of the accents that you can nonetheless

379
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,400
中文字幕
type on your Macs and PCs and you certainly

380
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,740
中文字幕
can't type these things, which are very much in vogue.

381
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,520
中文字幕
Which even though they're pictures, they're actually just characters.

382
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,020
中文字幕
Because it turns out some years ago, the world decided eight bits is not enough.

383
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,020
中文字幕
Let's start using something called Unicode, where you actually use

384
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,200
中文字幕
one or two or three or even four bytes.

385
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:33,450
中文字幕
So eight bits or 16 bits, 24 bits, or even 32 bits to represent characters.

386
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,940
中文字幕
And now, we have the ability to represent thousands or even

387
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,440
中文字幕
millions of characters.

388
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,540
中文字幕
And frankly, daresay, the result of that huge amount of availability

389
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,340
中文字幕
is partly why there are so many of these things these days.

390
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,540
中文字幕
And they just keep making more because there's just so many different numbers

391
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,320
中文字幕
available to us.

392
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,950
中文字幕
So Unicode is often a specific version of it called UTF-8,

393
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,210
中文字幕
which we'll see before long.

394
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,060
中文字幕
But let me ask this question here.

395
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:01,710
中文字幕
This is a crying face with joy, I think this is called.

396
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,830
中文字幕
So it turns out, according to Apple or iOS,

397
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,420
中文字幕
this is the most popular emoji that at least iPhone people

398
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,710
中文字幕
are sending to each other.

399
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,710
中文字幕
So when you're receiving this, though, if we can really take the fun out

400
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,860
中文字幕
of this, what pattern of bits are you actually receiving from your friend?

401
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,580
中文字幕
He or she is clearly trying to express some emotion,

402
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:24,030
中文字幕
but really, what your friend is sending you-- the decimal number 128,514.

403
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,670
中文字幕
Or really, if you looked at the zeros and ones coming

404
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,220
中文字幕
to you over the internet or airwaves, you're

405
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,540
中文字幕
getting this pattern of zeros and ones, which is hardly joyful or hardly

406
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,060
中文字幕
descriptive, but all your phone or computer

407
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,040
中文字幕
are doing is seeing this pattern of bits,

408
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,530
中文字幕
looking it up in like a little cheat sheet, and saying, oh.

409
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:44,220
中文字幕
Whenever I see this pattern of bits in the context of text like texting,

410
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,490
中文字幕
I should actually display it as that picture.

411
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,550
中文字幕
Now, that picture has a lot of yellow and other colors

412
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,050
中文字幕
in it, but how do we even get there?

413
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,410
中文字幕
Well, it turns out that this same pattern of numbers--

414
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:00,040
中文字幕
72, 73, 33-- which just to be sure, a moment ago, meant what?

415
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,540
中文字幕
Hi.

416
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,650
中文字幕
In the context of a textual program like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, texting,

417
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,940
中文字幕
this means hi.

418
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,900
中文字幕
But what if you saw this same pattern of bytes--

419
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,820
中文字幕
and again, we could draw the zeros and ones,

420
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,820
中文字幕
but it's not interesting anymore, so we're going

421
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,540
中文字幕
to abstract away at the decimal level.

422
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,450
中文字幕
If you got this same pattern of zeros and ones

423
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:21,060
中文字幕
or numbers in the context of like Photoshop or a browser

424
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,900
中文字幕
or some kind of photo program, well, it might make more sense

425
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,660
中文字幕
to interpret it not as text, but as imagery, some kind of colors.

426
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,120
中文字幕
Well, it turns out there's this other system in the world--

427
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,820
中文字幕
you might have seen this acronym before--

428
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,560
中文字幕
called RGB-- red, green, blue.

429
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,980
中文字幕
And this is just a way of humans having standardized years

430
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,940
中文字幕
ago that you know what?

431
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,910
中文字幕
If we want to represent a dot on someone's screen, otherwise known

432
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,950
中文字幕
as a pixel a tiny little square on the screen

433
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,880
中文字幕
of your phone, your laptop, or even TV these days,

434
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,900
中文字幕
we're going to use three bytes--

435
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,010
中文字幕
one byte to specify how much red should be in that specific pixel,

436
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,940
中文字幕
one more byte to specify how much green should be combined with red to form

437
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,400
中文字幕
that pixel, and then one more byte, a third,

438
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,550
中文字幕
to represent how much blue to combine with those other two colors

439
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,620
中文字幕
to make a new color all together.

440
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,230
中文字幕
So it's kind of like combining paints, except in this case,

441
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:13,810
中文字幕
it's more really waves of light in order to get a specific color using just

442
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,510
中文字幕
red, green, and blue as your palette.

443
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:20,180
中文字幕
And so if we were to see this red, green, blue pattern and say,

444
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:20,770
中文字幕
you know what?

445
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:25,780
中文字幕
Give me 72 red, 73 of green, and 33 of blue.

446
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:30,490
中文字幕
If the total possible range that I alluded to earlier is like 0 to 256,

447
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:35,770
中文字幕
or technically 0 to 255 if you start counting in computer science from zero,

448
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,590
中文字幕
this is like a medium amount of red, medium amount of green,

449
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:42,140
中文字幕
and just a little bit of blue, if the range goes from 0 to 255.

450
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,100
中文字幕
So if you combine these three things together

451
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,790
中文字幕
and you want to know what color you get--

452
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,770
中文字幕
yeah.

453
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,840
中文字幕
So it's kind of a light yellow that looks like this.

454
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,360
中文字幕
So if a computer is storing a single dot on the screen that

455
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,720
中文字幕
happens to be in yellow, what the computer's actually storing

456
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,640
中文字幕
is not this dot physically, but a pattern of three

457
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,600
中文字幕
bytes-- how much red, how much green, how much blue should the computer

458
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,560
中文字幕
display at this particular point.

459
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,230
中文字幕
So if we look at this crying face of joy and we kind of enhance or zoom in

460
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:14,320
中文字幕
on it here, you can actually see it start to pixelate, so to speak,

461
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,660
中文字幕
where you start to see the dots.

462
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,970
中文字幕
If I punch in a little more, now you can really

463
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,170
中文字幕
start to see the dots on the screen.

464
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,230
中文字幕
And if I go an even further, you can actually

465
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:26,250
中文字幕
see the tiny little squares that compose this image, most of which

466
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,430
中文字幕
at the zoom level are yellow, but a bunch of which are black,

467
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:33,310
中文字幕
a bunch of which are light black or dark yellow.

468
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,790
中文字幕
And that's what composes this image ultimately.

469
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:39,990
中文字幕
So this is to say if you count up all of the pixels on the screen

470
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:43,260
中文字幕
and then multiply it by one, two, three bytes, that's

471
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,950
中文字幕
how many bytes or kilobytes or megabytes, if you've heard those terms,

472
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:51,670
中文字幕
are going to be stored on your computer just to represent an image.

473
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:56,130
中文字幕
So we've gone from electricity to down here, so to speak, to zeros and ones,

474
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,050
中文字幕
to decimal, now to colors.

475
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,300
中文字幕
Well, with colors, you can get images.

476
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,540
中文字幕
What comes after images?

477
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,280
中文字幕
Well, we've all watched videos or movies certainly digitally these days.

478
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,530
中文字幕
Well, what is a movie or a video file?

479
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,220
中文字幕
How might that be implemented?

480
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,380
中文字幕
Say it a little louder.

481
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:13,880
中文字幕
Yeah.

482
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,120
中文字幕
It's a collection of images.

483
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,910
中文字幕
If you've ever heard of frames per second--

484
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:20,750
中文字幕
like movies tend to be 24 frames per second or 30 frames per second--

485
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,510
中文字幕
that just means that a typical movie, every second

486
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,810
中文字幕
is showing you 24 or 30 images per second

487
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:29,240
中文字幕
and they're just flying by so quickly that you actually

488
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,970
中文字幕
don't notice you're just watching a sequence of static images.

489
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:35,270
中文字幕
It's like as a kid, if you ever had one of those paper flip books where there's

490
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,060
中文字幕
tons of drawings in them, and as you flip through the pages,

491
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,770
中文字幕
you see things moving, but that's just because your eyes are just

492
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:45,230
中文字幕
seeing little snapshots ever so quickly of something moving on the paper.

493
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,010
中文字幕
That's all a video file actually is.

494
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:49,850
中文字幕
So if you have an iPhone and you've ever played with these animojis,

495
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:53,180
中文字幕
so to speak, well, all those are are little video files

496
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,700
中文字幕
composed of lots and lots and lots of images

497
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,060
中文字幕
that you have saved on your phone or texted to someone else.

498
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:03,150
中文字幕
And if we just think, now, we're at the point of video, but that's OK.

499
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,700
中文字幕
Videos are just bunches of images.

500
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,380
中文字幕
Images are just bunches of colors.

501
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,940
中文字幕
Colors are just patterns of bits.

502
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,650
中文字幕
And bits, at the end of the day, are just

503
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:12,800
中文字幕
the result of electricity coming into my machine or transistors

504
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,570
中文字幕
turning switches on and off.

505
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:18,170
中文字幕
Like we've all of a sudden to hold this entire story, but none of us

506
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:21,710
中文字幕
ever is going to need to really think about binary in the context of videos

507
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,400
中文字幕
because a video is just an abstraction on top of bunches of images,

508
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,430
中文字幕
and images are just an abstraction on top bunches of pixels, and so forth.

509
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,550
中文字幕
So we can keep painting this hierarchy that

510
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,010
中文字幕
just allows us to talk about things at a more useful level,

511
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,930
中文字幕
and the reason we had this conversation is

512
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:38,480
中文字幕
just because we needed a way to represent

513
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,440
中文字幕
inputs and outputs to problems.

514
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,400
中文字幕
Let me pause there for just a second to see if there's any questions.

515
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,830
中文字幕
Anything at all?

516
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,460
中文字幕
No?

517
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:49,960
中文字幕
All right.

518
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,480
中文字幕
So what's inside this black box?

519
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,080
中文字幕
Well, it turns out this is where the really interesting work starts

520
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,100
中文字幕
to happen and the thought starts to come in.

521
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,810
中文字幕
This is the proverbial algorithms, step by step instructions

522
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,160
中文字幕
for solving some problem.

523
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,410
中文字幕
And some of you might have solved this problem before,

524
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,480
中文字幕
either digitally or textually, but of course,

525
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,770
中文字幕
if you have contacts in your phone these days

526
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,650
中文字幕
and you've got bunches of friends and family,

527
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,040
中文字幕
odds are they're alphabetized by first name or last name.

528
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,540
中文字幕
And you have auto complete these days, but it really is just

529
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,300
中文字幕
a long list of names and numbers.

530
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,890
中文字幕
That's not all that different from yesteryear's implementation

531
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:24,640
中文字幕
of the same problem, which was this device here, a phonebook.

532
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,120
中文字幕
Now, this phonebook might have a friend of ours in it, say Mike Smith,

533
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,490
中文字幕
whose last name starts with S. And I could, of course,

534
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,800
中文字幕
if trying to find Mike Smith, start by looking

535
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,780
中文字幕
at the first page, the second page, the third page, the fourth page,

536
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,790
中文字幕
and eventually, just hopefully find Mike Smith.

537
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,640
中文字幕
Indeed, is this algorithm, this step by step process,

538
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,710
中文字幕
correct for finding someone like Mike Smith?

539
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,210
中文字幕
Yeah.

540
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:46,940
中文字幕
It's correct.

541
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,970
中文字幕
It's stupid and slow perhaps because it's

542
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:51,430
中文字幕
going to take forever in a phone book of this size,

543
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:54,390
中文字幕
but it is correct because if Mike's in here, I will, in fact, find him.

544
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,520
中文字幕
But I could do this better.

545
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,140
中文字幕
I could do it sort of two at a time.

546
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,880
中文字幕
So two, four, six, eight, 10-- or imperfectly--

547
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,560
中文字幕
10, 12, 14.

548
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,450
中文字幕
Is that faster?

549
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:06,640
中文字幕
Obviously, it's going twice as fast.

550
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,470
中文字幕
Is it correct?

551
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:08,970
中文字幕
No.

552
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,640
中文字幕
Why is it not correct?

553
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,140
中文字幕
Yeah.

554
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,260
中文字幕
I might miss him, right?

555
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,560
中文字幕
Mike just accidentally might eventually get sandwiched between two pages

556
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,380
中文字幕
and I have the unlucky experience of just missing him.

557
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,430
中文字幕
Now, is it fixable?

558
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,030
中文字幕
Yeah.

559
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:24,440
中文字幕
I can probably, once I hit like SN or the T section, for instance--

560
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,690
中文字幕
I can just say, obviously, I've gone too far for Mike.

561
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,830
中文字幕
Let me just double back one or just a few pages.

562
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,030
中文字幕
So it is fixable.

563
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:33,380
中文字幕
And so long as I've saved time by flying through this twice as fast,

564
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:37,310
中文字幕
can I at least afford to spend a few more steps at the very end just

565
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,420
中文字幕
to find Mike Smith?

566
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,920
中文字幕
But none of us are going to do that.

567
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,440
中文字幕
And our Apple devices and Android devices certainly

568
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,330
中文字幕
don't do that for efficiency today.

569
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:48,210
中文字幕
Odds are most of us are going to do what to find someone in any book like this?

570
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:48,710
中文字幕
Yeah.

571
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:51,740
中文字幕
Open to roughly the middle or maybe bias ourselves toward the end

572
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,090
中文字幕
because S is after the middle.

573
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:55,340
中文字幕
But you know, I'm in the middle of the phonebook here.

574
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,730
中文字幕
And now, if I know that Mike is in the S's and therefore over here,

575
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:01,260
中文字幕
where do I know he's not?

576
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,200
中文字幕
He's not in the beginning and I can literally

577
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,670
中文字幕
tear a problem like this in half, throw figuratively and literally half

578
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:11,540
中文字幕
of the problem away, and be left with fundamentally the same problem,

579
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,470
中文字幕
but it's half as big.

580
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,670
中文字幕
I went from like-- whatever--

581
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:17,300
中文字幕
1,000 pages to 500 pages and I can now repeat this algorithm.

582
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,160
中文字幕
I look down.

583
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,120
中文字幕
I'm a little too far.

584
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,450
中文字幕
I'm in the T section now.

585
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:20,990
中文字幕
OK.

586
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:25,010
中文字幕
I can again tear the problem in half, throw that half away,

587
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:29,180
中文字幕
taking a 500 page byte out, a 250 page byte out, now leaving myself

588
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,040
中文字幕
with just 250 pages more.

589
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,720
中文字幕
And notice just how quickly I got here.

590
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,260
中文字幕
The first two algorithms got me from 1,000 to 999 to 998, or 1,000 to 998

591
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,910
中文字幕
to 996.

592
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:43,760
中文字幕
But here, I went from 1,000 to 500 to 250.

593
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,660
中文字幕
Feels like we're making up time here.

594
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,540
中文字幕
And indeed, if I keep repeating this process,

595
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,390
中文字幕
hopefully, I'll be left with just one page of the book

596
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:55,100
中文字幕
that Mike is either on or not, at which point, I will call him.

597
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,850
中文字幕
And so that's an algorithm that honestly leverages probably all the intuition we

598
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,130
中文字幕
have and a lot of what programming is going to be,

599
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:04,480
中文字幕
is thinking about a problem like this, figuring out how to divide and conquer

600
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,500
中文字幕
it, and then expressing yourself in a way

601
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,030
中文字幕
that the computer can then solve that problem for you.

602
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:12,530
中文字幕
And just to paint a picture of how much better this algorithm is, well,

603
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,890
中文字幕
if this is just a very abstract chart where we have on the vertical,

604
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:18,530
中文字幕
or y-axis, how much time it takes to solve a problem,

605
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:21,260
中文字幕
and on the horizontal axis how big the problem is--

606
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,330
中文字幕
so the farther out you go this way, the more pages in the problem,

607
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:25,670
中文字幕
the more pages in the phonebook.

608
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:28,070
中文字幕
And the higher you go up here, the more seconds or page

609
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,270
中文字幕
turns it's going to take.

610
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:32,720
中文字幕
That first algorithm is just like a linear slope,

611
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,660
中文字幕
so to speak, because for every additional page in the book,

612
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,190
中文字幕
it might take me one more second.

613
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,670
中文字幕
Right, up.

614
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:41,700
中文字幕
It's just a one for one relationship with pages.

615
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,820
中文字幕
The second algorithm, if I plot it, where

616
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,530
中文字幕
I'm flying through twice as fast, what is

617
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,070
中文字幕
that line going to look like instead?

618
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:51,930
中文字幕
Yeah.

619
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,550
中文字幕
It's going to look lower than this one.

620
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,550
中文字幕
It's still going to be a straight line because now, there's a two to one

621
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,580
中文字幕
relationship, but if you've got a phone book that's got this many pages,

622
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,910
中文字幕
and in the first algorithm, it took this long, here,

623
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:07,410
中文字幕
well, in the second algorithm, it will take half as many steps, plus or minus

624
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:09,840
中文字幕
or two if you need to actually double back a little bit.

625
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,660
中文字幕
But that third algorithm is what we'll call logarithmic.

626
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,030
中文字幕
If n is the number of pages in the phone book,

627
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,890
中文字幕
the first algorithm, in the very worst case,

628
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,640
中文字幕
might take all n pages to find Mike Smith.

629
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,470
中文字幕
The second algorithm is going to take half as many steps because I'm

630
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,920
中文字幕
flying through it two at a time.

631
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,250
中文字幕
But the third algorithm is going to look and feel like this.

632
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:30,720
中文字幕
It's going to be curved and ever so slowly rising and rising and rising,

633
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,950
中文字幕
the implication of which is if Verizon or the phone company

634
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,790
中文字幕
doubles the number of pages in the phonebook

635
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:39,090
中文字幕
next year because Cambridge and Somerville merged together in the phone

636
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,230
中文字幕
book and we now have 2,000 pages.

637
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:45,150
中文字幕
Well, how many more steps does my third algorithm take?

638
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:45,690
中文字幕
Just one.

639
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,300
中文字幕
Because I can take a 1,000 page bite out of the problem

640
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:52,140
中文字幕
with that clever algorithm, whereas my first two algorithms would take it

641
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,150
中文字幕
one or just two pages at a time.

642
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:58,740
中文字幕
So that is to say we have to hugely increase the size of this problem

643
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:03,450
中文字幕
just for the number of seconds or page turns to appreciably actually increase.

644
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,490
中文字幕
And so as we start to learn about programming,

645
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:08,670
中文字幕
it's, again, going to be leveraging of this intuition in order

646
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:13,260
中文字幕
to actually solve problems and code more effectively than we

647
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:17,820
中文字幕
might without that intuition alone.

648
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,560
中文字幕
So let's formalize this now.

649
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,920
中文字幕
So that was kind of a very intuitive way of dividing and conquering a problem.

650
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,750
中文字幕
Just kind of made sense to go in the middle,

651
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,940
中文字幕
tear it, then go to the other half or the other half

652
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,010
中文字幕
and tear it again, and so forth.

653
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:33,990
中文字幕
But a computer, even as cool as Alexa and Google Home and all of this are,

654
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,120
中文字幕
you can't really just talk to them as another human

655
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,800
中文字幕
and have them execute things correctly.

656
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,400
中文字幕
I struggle just to get Siri to set a timer on my phone.

657
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,950
中文字幕
So we're not quite there yet, so we're still at the age

658
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,830
中文字幕
where we have to be ever so precise with computers,

659
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:50,430
中文字幕
voice activated or otherwise, and so thus enter pseudocode for now.

660
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,560
中文字幕
Pseudocode has no formal definition.

661
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:57,000
中文字幕
This is just a way of saying use English like syntax or any spoken language

662
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,210
中文字幕
and just express yourself succinctly and correctly

663
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:03,090
中文字幕
so that a computer or a robot or even another person

664
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:05,640
中文字幕
can understand what it is you're trying to say.

665
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,340
中文字幕
So here, I propose, is an algorithm written

666
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,650
中文字幕
in pseudocode, English like syntax, that just gets my point across.

667
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,530
中文字幕
And I could write this in any number of ways.

668
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:16,680
中文字幕
I've numbered the steps from zero on up, just for the sake of discussion,

669
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,900
中文字幕
but this would seem to capture what I did there.

670
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,220
中文字幕
Pick up the phone book.

671
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,840
中文字幕
Open to the middle of the phone.

672
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,710
中文字幕
Look at the names.

673
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:25,260
中文字幕
If Smith is among the names, call Mike.

674
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,660
中文字幕
Else, if Mike Smith is earlier in the book,

675
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,050
中文字幕
go to the left, specifically the middle of the left half of the book,

676
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,910
中文字幕
and then go back to step two.

677
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:35,650
中文字幕
Because indeed, I was just doing the same thing again and again,

678
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:38,350
中文字幕
and the reason I wasn't doing it forever was because every time I

679
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:42,060
中文字幕
repeated myself by opening and tearing, I was shrinking the problem.

680
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,850
中文字幕
And I can only shrink a problem of some fixed finite size

681
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:47,220
中文字幕
so many times until I get just one page, and so

682
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,060
中文字幕
if I continue this logic looking to the right or to the left or just quitting,

683
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,460
中文字幕
if I don't find Mike at all on the last page,

684
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,700
中文字幕
this would seem to capture more precisely that code.

685
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,640
中文字幕
Well, let's actually excerpt from this now a few concepts

686
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,980
中文字幕
and then start to apply them to actual code.

687
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,730
中文字幕
Highlighted in yellow here, I dare say, are all of the verbs or actions.

688
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,550
中文字幕
These are the functions, as we're going to start calling them,

689
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,330
中文字幕
in this algorithm.

690
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:12,480
中文字幕
A function is just a specific step, a specific action

691
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,600
中文字幕
you take in order to do something.

692
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,800
中文字幕
And so in yellow here-- pick up, open to, look at, call, open, quit

693
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,940
中文字幕
are all actions or verbs.

694
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,400
中文字幕
Are henceforth, we'll call them functions.

695
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,450
中文字幕
Meanwhile, highlighted in yellow here-- if, else if, else if, else.

696
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,320
中文字幕
These are kind of starting to ask questions.

697
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,620
中文字幕
What might these be called if you have some familiarity?

698
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,120
中文字幕
Yes.

699
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,490
中文字幕
Turns out many programming languages, if you've seen any before,

700
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,650
中文字幕
would call these conditions.

701
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:39,060
中文字幕
They're branches, or proverbial forks in the road.

702
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,840
中文字幕
If this is true, go this way.

703
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,160
中文字幕
Else, maybe go this other way, or perhaps a third or fourth direction

704
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,030
中文字幕
altogether.

705
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:48,630
中文字幕
Meanwhile, if we actually look at these highlighted phrases--

706
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:51,420
中文字幕
if Smith is among names or if Smith is earlier in book

707
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,710
中文字幕
or Smith is later in book--

708
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:56,440
中文字幕
these are the specific questions we're asking in order to make that decision.

709
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,130
中文字幕
These are known as Boolean expressions, named after a gentleman

710
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,170
中文字幕
by the last name of Boole some years ago.

711
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,120
中文字幕
And so a Boolean expression is just a question

712
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,340
中文字幕
that has a yes or no answer, a true false answer, a one zero

713
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,710
中文字幕
answer, if you will.

714
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:11,340
中文字幕
And that's a nice mapping to what computers are really good at.

715
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,420
中文字幕
So within conditions, you have Boolean expressions

716
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,680
中文字幕
to decide which fork in the road you want to go down.

717
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,510
中文字幕
And then lastly, highlighted in yellow here

718
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:21,210
中文字幕
is go back to step 2 in a couple of places.

719
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:23,940
中文字幕
This is inducing some kind of cycle or loop

720
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,750
中文字幕
that's telling the computer to do something again and again and again.

721
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:31,620
中文字幕
So in short, we have these building blocks already conceptually.

722
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,260
中文字幕
And it turns out, we can now start to translate these

723
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,220
中文字幕
to an actual programming language.

724
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,310
中文字幕
The first of the languages we'll introduce in CS50

725
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,830
中文字幕
is something called Scratch.

726
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,670
中文字幕
Turns out this is not a text based language,

727
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,130
中文字幕
like in my English pseudocode there, but it's graphical

728
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,680
中文字幕
and things look like puzzle pieces that you can drag and drop

729
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,870
中文字幕
and they interconnect if it makes logical sense to do so.

730
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,390
中文字幕
And in fact, some of you might have played this back in the day as kids

731
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,030
中文字幕
or even more recently because it's actually targeted typically

732
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,910
中文字幕
at students in like after school programs who

733
00:32:55,910 --> 00:33:00,170
中文字幕
just want to learn more methodical, more algorithmic, or computational thinking.

734
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,930
中文字幕
And we're going to use it to explore not only these building

735
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,940
中文字幕
blocks, but a few others, as well.

736
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,600
中文字幕
It turns out in the other languages we'll explore in CS50 and beyond,

737
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,560
中文字幕
are languages like C that we'll actually transition to as quickly as next week,

738
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,580
中文字幕
to then translate what we do this week in Scratch to next week in C.

739
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,590
中文字幕
And in languages like Python and JavaScript

740
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:21,650
中文字幕
and SQL, which we'll also explore, do we have other capabilities--

741
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:24,020
中文字幕
the ability to store data in variables, so to speak,

742
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:27,830
中文字幕
to use threads, which means get the computer to do multiple things at once,

743
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:30,920
中文字幕
events, to mean listen for things happening, like a click

744
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,920
中文字幕
on the page or a human typing or even saying something.

745
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,050
中文字幕
We'll be able to do all of the things that you take

746
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,180
中文字幕
for granted in your very own phones.

747
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:41,040
中文字幕
And we'll do this first by way of this guy.

748
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,060
中文字幕
So this is Scratch, the default cat that comes with this programming

749
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,890
中文字幕
language from MIT's media lab.

750
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,990
中文字幕
And via Scratch can we start programming him to move up,

751
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:52,550
中文字幕
down, left, right, say something, utter something, and other commands

752
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,580
中文字幕
all together.

753
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,720
中文字幕
In fact, let me go ahead and switch contexts here

754
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,200
中文字幕
to show you the very first thing I ever wrote in Scratch.

755
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,370
中文字幕
It was back in the day when I was in graduate school

756
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:03,720
中文字幕
and Scratch had just been invented by MIT.

757
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,540
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and open this.

758
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,710
中文字幕
And I called it Oscar Time.

759
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,630
中文字幕
And if we could perhaps have a volunteer come on up for just a moment.

760
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,180
中文字幕
You have to be comfortable being on stage and on the internet.

761
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,590
中文字幕
How about here in the white shirt?

762
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,550
中文字幕
I saw your hand first.

763
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,020
中文字幕
Come on down.

764
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,460
中文字幕
So this is Oscar Time.

765
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,740
中文字幕
It's implemented in a language called Scratch.

766
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:25,850
中文字幕
And at the end of the day, all that is underneath the hood of this program

767
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:29,190
中文字幕
is functions and loops and conditions and a few other of these concepts.

768
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:29,690
中文字幕
Hi.

769
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:30,080
中文字幕
What's your name?

770
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:30,870
中文字幕
AVIVA: Aviva.

771
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:31,280
中文字幕
DAVID MALAN: Aviva.

772
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:31,710
中文字幕
David.

773
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,410
中文字幕
Nice to meet you.

774
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:33,980
中文字幕
Come on over here.

775
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:37,070
中文字幕
And in just a moment, I'm going to go ahead and click

776
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,230
中文字幕
the green flag at the top left hand corner, which

777
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,460
中文字幕
is going to play this game.

778
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,330
中文字幕
And we'll see on the screen the instructions.

779
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,810
中文字幕
[MUSIC PLAYING]

780
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:50,300
中文字幕
OSCAR: (SINGING) Oh, I love trash.

781
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,500
中文字幕
Anything dirty or dingy or dusty.

782
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:58,670
中文字幕
Anything ragged or rotten or rusty.

783
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:02,710
中文字幕
Yes, I love trash.

784
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,300
中文字幕
If you really want to see something trashy, look at this.

785
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,400
中文字幕
I have here a sneaker that's tattered and worn.

786
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,340
中文字幕
It's all full of holes and the laces are torn.

787
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:17,710
中文字幕
A gift from my mother the day I was born.

788
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:21,270
中文字幕
I love it because it's trash.

789
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:25,650
中文字幕
Oh, I love trash.

790
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:29,880
中文字幕
Anything dirty or dingy or dusty.

791
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,190
中文字幕
Anything ragged or rotten or rusty.

792
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:37,290
中文字幕
Yes, I love trash.

793
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:40,610
中文字幕
Here's some more rotten stuff.

794
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:43,370
中文字幕
I have here some newspaper 13 months old.

795
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,330
中文字幕
DAVID MALAN: All right.

796
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:46,950
中文字幕
Everybody, give a round of applause for Aviva for coming on up.

797
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:47,750
中文字幕
Thank you.

798
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:48,250
中文字幕
Here.

799
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:48,750
中文字幕
Aviva.

800
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,230
中文字幕
[APPLAUSE]

801
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,180
中文字幕
A little CS50 stress ball.

802
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:56,150
中文字幕
So suffice it to say, if you're tired of this song,

803
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:59,900
中文字幕
consider how tired I was eight hours later while debugging and building

804
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,590
中文字幕
this program.

805
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,090
中文字幕
But consider what it is we just saw.

806
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:05,610
中文字幕
It's this interactive game and stuff is animated and music is playing.

807
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:09,560
中文字幕
But if you focus on decomposing, so to speak, this program into just

808
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:13,520
中文字幕
basic building blocks, this is just kind of a big abstraction over some lower

809
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,380
中文字幕
level pieces of functionality.

810
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,580
中文字幕
Like this trash can here.

811
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,830
中文字幕
At the moment, it's just a picture, and on occasion,

812
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:21,580
中文字幕
as soon as Aviva dropped something into the trash, the lid came up

813
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,680
中文字幕
and Oscar came out, he said something, and then he went back down.

814
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,720
中文字幕
But that animation is super simplistic.

815
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,490
中文字幕
It was just a sequence of 1, 2, 3, or so images displaying and then

816
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,920
中文字幕
going back down to create the illusion of animation.

817
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,290
中文字幕
Meanwhile, every time Oscar said something,

818
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:39,320
中文字幕
that was keeping track of her score in what's called a variable.

819
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,900
中文字幕
In algebra, you have x and y and z, but in programming, you have the same idea,

820
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,530
中文字幕
but it's generally more useful to call them more descriptively,

821
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:46,370
中文字幕
like your score.

822
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,620
中文字幕
And so there's probably a variable in this game called

823
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,290
中文字幕
score that was just keeping track of how many times

824
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:53,240
中文字幕
Aviva had dropped something into the trash.

825
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,650
中文字幕
Meanwhile, the trash itself and the shoe and the newspaper-- and even more

826
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:00,470
中文字幕
things happen eventually-- were falling from the sky

827
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,680
中文字幕
at sort of random locations, and that's because I programmed the game

828
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,230
中文字幕
to sort of start the trash here or over here, just

829
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,950
中文字幕
to make it a little more challenging as the game picked up.

830
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,540
中文字幕
And in fact, things start falling faster and faster over time,

831
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:14,550
中文字幕
like a typical game, getting more and more difficult.

832
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,830
中文字幕
So how do we get to something like that?

833
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:19,130
中文字幕
Well, let me go ahead and open up Scratch itself

834
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,240
中文字幕
and introduce the environment.

835
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,200
中文字幕
So in Scratch, you essentially have three general areas.

836
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,660
中文字幕
And it's web based, and so you can do this on any computer.

837
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,510
中文字幕
And in the left hand side here, you have those puzzle pieces

838
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,920
中文字幕
to which I referred earlier.

839
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:36,140
中文字幕
These puzzle pieces are all mapping to functions or loops or conditions

840
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,140
中文字幕
or variables, things that we saw before, and I'm

841
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,180
中文字幕
going to able to drag and drop them into the middle in order

842
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,040
中文字幕
to interconnect them and write my program,

843
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,430
中文字幕
which we'll do in just a moment.

844
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:48,330
中文字幕
Meanwhile, Scratch lives in this stage, this world, where he can move up,

845
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,250
中文字幕
down, left, right.

846
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,870
中文字幕
You can change what Scratch looks like.

847
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,300
中文字幕
You can add other characters, otherwise known as sprites,

848
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,140
中文字幕
in order to have multiple things happening at once.

849
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,680
中文字幕
And of course, you can fullscreen it.

850
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,410
中文字幕
And so the Oscar Time game a moment ago was actually a whole bunch of sprites.

851
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:02,250
中文字幕
Oscar's trash can was one.

852
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,640
中文字幕
Each piece of trash was another sprite.

853
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,050
中文字幕
The newspaper was a sprite, and so forth.

854
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:11,250
中文字幕
So each of them were separate programs running in parallel at the same time.

855
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,110
中文字幕
So let's actually make him do something.

856
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:16,770
中文字幕
It turns out that if I jump down to, say, events,

857
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,770
中文字幕
I'm going to see one of the most powerful blocks

858
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:22,000
中文字幕
from the get go, which is this when green flag clicked.

859
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
中文字幕
That's indeed how I started the game with Aviva,

860
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,260
中文字幕
by clicking just above Scratch's world this green flag.

861
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,030
中文字幕
And if I wanted to stop it, as I did, you

862
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,130
中文字幕
can click the red stop sign to say stop.

863
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:34,730
中文字幕
Meanwhile, the green flag, I can constantly

864
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:37,220
中文字幕
listen for by dragging and dropping this puzzle piece.

865
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,710
中文字幕
When the green flag is clicked, what do I want to do?

866
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,470
中文字幕
Well, let me go up to looks.

867
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,140
中文字幕
And these are just different categories.

868
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,180
中文字幕
And we can scroll through all the different colorful blocks,

869
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,240
中文字幕
but they pretty much just do what they say.

870
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,370
中文字幕
I'm going to go under looks, where I know there to be a block that's called

871
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,990
中文字幕
say, and I'm going to go ahead and type the most canonical computer science

872
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,500
中文字幕
thing-- hello world--

873
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,160
中文字幕
in this box.

874
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,550
中文字幕
So notice that functions themselves can actually

875
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:01,610
中文字幕
take inputs and the input to this function, say,

876
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,080
中文字幕
is going to be hello world.

877
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,530
中文字幕
If I now go over to the green flag and click it--

878
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:07,530
中文字幕
hello world.

879
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:08,030
中文字幕
All right.

880
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:11,000
中文字幕
So not all that difficult. Not all that interesting.

881
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,810
中文字幕
But it actually got the job done, and so my program is indeed just this.

882
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,060
中文字幕
Well, how might I make this a little more interesting?

883
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,730
中文字幕
Just saying, hello world all the time isn't all that compelling.

884
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:20,620
中文字幕
Well, you know what?

885
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,170
中文字幕
Let me think.

886
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:22,550
中文字幕
Let me undo this.

887
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,380
中文字幕
Let me scroll down to sensing.

888
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,880
中文字幕
And notice this.

889
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,490
中文字幕
Functions can also take input from a human

890
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:32,270
中文字幕
and functions can hand you back a value, a so-called return value.

891
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:35,090
中文字幕
So this block here, ask something-- by default, it says,

892
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:36,500
中文字幕
what's your name and weight--

893
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,350
中文字幕
is another function built into Scratch that allows me to do this.

894
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:41,420
中文字幕
So I'm going to go ahead and drag this here

895
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,950
中文字幕
and I'm going to let it say, what's your name?

896
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:46,990
中文字幕
Notice now that below this block is a special block,

897
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:48,650
中文字幕
whatever it is the block returns.

898
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:51,560
中文字幕
So answer is whatever the human is going to type in.

899
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:56,060
中文字幕
And if I want to now say what the human typed in, let me go again to looks.

900
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,060
中文字幕
Go to say.

901
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,150
中文字幕
And notice that these blocks are kind of magnetic.

902
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,340
中文字幕
They want to snap together.

903
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,130
中文字幕
So I'm going to go ahead and let go there.

904
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:05,160
中文字幕
And if I go back to sensing and grab answer,

905
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,730
中文字幕
notice that even though it's not quite the same size,

906
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,740
中文字幕
it's going to grow to fill, and now, I can

907
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,890
中文字幕
have my program ask the user what his or her name is and then

908
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,930
中文字幕
say whatever that answer is.

909
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:18,020
中文字幕
So let me go ahead and stop and click play again.

910
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:21,020
中文字幕
Notice it's asking me for my name, so let me go ahead and type in David.

911
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,020
中文字幕
Enter.

912
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:22,520
中文字幕
OK.

913
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,770
中文字幕
It's a little weird way to greet someone.

914
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:25,790
中文字幕
David.

915
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,490
中文字幕
So it'd be nice to clean that up a bit.

916
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:29,330
中文字幕
So you know what?

917
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:31,380
中文字幕
I know this only from having poked around before.

918
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,230
中文字幕
Not all of this is obvious at first glance.

919
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,320
中文字幕
But it turns out that under operators, the category,

920
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,070
中文字幕
there's this thing here-- join apple and banana.

921
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,320
中文字幕
Which are just default values.

922
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,460
中文字幕
You can change them.

923
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,710
中文字幕
Because what do I want to do?

924
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:47,720
中文字幕
I want to say hello, David, or whoever, so I kind of want to say hello, comma,

925
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,710
中文字幕
and then, David-- whatever the human typed in.

926
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,090
中文字幕
And that's what join lets you do.

927
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:54,880
中文字幕
It lets you join or concatenate two phrases that are somehow

928
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,140
中文字幕
provided by you or the user.

929
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,690
中文字幕
So let me pull this out, the answer.

930
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,750
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and grab the join block.

931
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,650
中文字幕
Notice it, too, is going to grow to fill.

932
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:09,010
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and say, hello, comma, space, and now, drag answer into there.

933
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:11,770
中文字幕
And notice this nesting.

934
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:12,520
中文字幕
Just like in math.

935
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,360
中文字幕
This nesting of functions.

936
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,700
中文字幕
I can first join hello and answer by taking those two things as input

937
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,710
中文字幕
and then pass them to say as another input

938
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,480
中文字幕
because these things are layered on top.

939
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,420
中文字幕
And so now, if I stop this and play it again and say, David--

940
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,250
中文字幕
hello, David.

941
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:30,700
中文字幕
Now, we have the makings of a more interesting interactive program

942
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,290
中文字幕
that isn't just hardcoded.

943
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:38,080
中文字幕
Of course, it's not nearly as audible as something like Oscar Time a moment ago.

944
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,380
中文字幕
So let me go ahead and do this.

945
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:43,660
中文字幕
Let me start over altogether and treat Scratch like the cat he is

946
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,570
中文字幕
and just start the sound called meow.

947
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,130
中文字幕
So it turns out there's a category of blocks called sound,

948
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,740
中文字幕
and within sound, there is play some default sounds.

949
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,400
中文字幕
So start sound meow.

950
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,070
中文字幕
And now, things will get a little cuter.

951
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,480
中文字幕
[MEOW]

952
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,940
中文字幕
Aw.

953
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,010
中文字幕
And now, again.

954
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,010
中文字幕
[MEOW]

955
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:03,200
中文字幕
And I can kind of simulate a cat by [MEOW] standing here for a while

956
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,610
中文字幕
and keeping to click this button.

957
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:05,360
中文字幕
But you know what?

958
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,890
中文字幕
Let me make him meow few times because that's more realistic.

959
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:09,580
中文字幕
So let me grab a second one and a third one.

960
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,570
中文字幕
And you can get this infinite supply of blocks.

961
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,230
中文字幕
Let me hit play.

962
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,620
中文字幕
[MEOW]

963
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,320
中文字幕
Seems like a bug.

964
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:17,990
中文字幕
Let's try again.

965
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:18,780
中文字幕
Play.

966
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,140
中文字幕
[MEOW]

967
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,570
中文字幕
This is my first bug, or mistake.

968
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:24,710
中文字幕
This looks correct.

969
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:28,700
中文字幕
It says when green flag clicked, start sound meow, start sound meow,

970
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,020
中文字幕
start sound meow.

971
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:33,490
中文字幕
Why am I only hearing one meow?

972
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:34,980
中文字幕
Yeah.

973
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,960
中文字幕
They're kind of at the same time or so close to the same time

974
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,050
中文字幕
that the sounds are kind of tripping over each other and just overlapping,

975
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:41,550
中文字幕
right?

976
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,720
中文字幕
The block literally says, start sound meow.

977
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,120
中文字幕
But computers are really fast.

978
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,030
中文字幕
If you've heard of the expression gigahertz, that's a unit of measure.

979
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:52,300
中文字幕
And if your computer has a one gigahertz CPU, central processing unit, or brain,

980
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:55,660
中文字幕
that means it can literally do like a billion things per second.

981
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:59,200
中文字幕
It can certainly start three sounds super fast.

982
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,200
中文字幕
And if they're effectively all happening one after the other

983
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,290
中文字幕
before the sound even finishes, you're just hearing one net effect.

984
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:06,680
中文字幕
So how can we fix this?

985
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,880
中文字幕
Well, I can actually go and fix this with this block here--

986
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,190
中文字幕
play sound meow until done.

987
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:15,550
中文字幕
Play sound meow until done.

988
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,240
中文字幕
And now.

989
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,510
中文字幕
[MEOWING]

990
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:19,010
中文字幕
OK.

991
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:20,890
中文字幕
It's a little unhappy, this particular cat,

992
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,730
中文字幕
but at least it's now more correct.

993
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:25,420
中文字幕
And, as it turns out, if I go to control--

994
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,100
中文字幕
you know what?

995
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,770
中文字幕
There's this block here-- wait some number of seconds.

996
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:30,940
中文字幕
I can go ahead and insert this here.

997
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,560
中文字幕
Let me do another one here.

998
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,510
中文字幕
And now, hit play.

999
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:36,910
中文字幕
[MEOWING]

1000
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:40,170
中文字幕
You know, it's not bad.

1001
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:43,230
中文字幕
It now sounds a little more realistic.

1002
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,510
中文字幕
But honestly, if I keep doing this-- or you know what?

1003
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:47,840
中文字幕
You can actually right click or control click on blocks,

1004
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,020
中文字幕
duplicate them, and just copy and paste even more if you want them.

1005
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:55,440
中文字幕
So if I were to do this, now, it's just going to go six times.

1006
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,390
中文字幕
And then I could copy it again and go 12 times.

1007
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:59,140
中文字幕
But there's got to be a better way, right?

1008
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,480
中文字幕
This is now bad programming.

1009
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,770
中文字幕
This is bad design.

1010
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:04,620
中文字幕
Because I'm literally copying and pasting, albeit, graphically.

1011
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,170
中文字幕
But we've already seen a building block with which

1012
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:09,390
中文字幕
we can design this program better.

1013
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:11,190
中文字幕
It's correct, but it's not well designed.

1014
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:15,820
中文字幕
What would the building block be that I need to make this a little cleaner?

1015
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,320
中文字幕
OK.

1016
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:16,860
中文字幕
A four loop.

1017
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,150
中文字幕
Doesn't quite exist in Scratch.

1018
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:21,300
中文字幕
But a loop fundamentally does something cyclically.

1019
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,980
中文字幕
And indeed, if I go under control and start poking around,

1020
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,910
中文字幕
you'll notice that there's a few blocks that might apply here.

1021
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:29,010
中文字幕
There's the repeat block some number of times

1022
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:32,400
中文字幕
or the forever block, both of which sound like loops, or cycles.

1023
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,460
中文字幕
So sure enough, let me go ahead here and I can throw away blocks

1024
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,110
中文字幕
by just dragging them to the left.

1025
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:40,080
中文字幕
Let me pull this out for a second.

1026
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,460
中文字幕
And then just say forever play this sound, and then wait one second.

1027
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,070
中文字幕
So now, my program looks like this.

1028
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:50,360
中文字幕
[MEOWING]

1029
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:56,770
中文字幕
You know, we'll never know if it's technically correct because it's just

1030
00:44:56,770 --> 00:45:00,130
中文字幕
going to go, we think, forever, but it looks like this is correct.

1031
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,320
中文字幕
And it was a lot less code and it's a lot easier

1032
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,260
中文字幕
to maintain because if I want him to kind of get sleepy,

1033
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:09,150
中文字幕
I can then maybe say two seconds instead.

1034
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:10,560
中文字幕
[MEOW]

1035
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,730
中文字幕
You know, and we can adjust this on the fly as we go.

1036
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:15,710
中文字幕
But let's start to combine some of these ideas

1037
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:19,460
中文字幕
now and change what it is the ultimate effect is.

1038
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,310
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and open an example I made in advance.

1039
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:24,260
中文字幕
This one's called Count Zero.

1040
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:27,510
中文字幕
And we'll put this on the website later so that you can play with if you like.

1041
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:29,630
中文字幕
And this is kind of the opposite of counting sheep.

1042
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:32,180
中文字幕
Rather than me or the person sleeping counting sheep,

1043
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:34,440
中文字幕
this sheep will count itself.

1044
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,130
中文字幕
So let me go ahead and just play.

1045
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:41,720
中文字幕
And adorably, he seems to just be counting 1, 2, 3.

1046
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,800
中文字幕
But why is that?

1047
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,420
中文字幕
He's just going to count forever.

1048
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:47,330
中文字幕
But let's look at the blocks with which he is counting forever.

1049
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:49,420
中文字幕
When green flag clicked, set counter.

1050
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:51,720
中文字幕
Turns out this orange box is what we called a variable.

1051
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,570
中文字幕
So in algebra, it would be like x or y or z.

1052
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:54,780
中文字幕
Those are not descriptive.

1053
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:58,490
中文字幕
I called this one counter instead, but I could have called it x or y or z.

1054
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:03,080
中文字幕
And then I forever say the counter for one second, then wait one second,

1055
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,910
中文字幕
and then change the counter by one, which

1056
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:06,410
中文字幕
technically means just increment it.

1057
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:07,430
中文字幕
Add 1 to it.

1058
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:10,190
中文字幕
And the sheep is just going to therefore count up and up and up.

1059
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:11,900
中文字幕
Now, this is a little tedious, but that's

1060
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:15,120
中文字幕
kind of the point of counting sheep, of course, to fall asleep.

1061
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,960
中文字幕
But what if the sheep actually kind of liked counting a little faster?

1062
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,500
中文字幕
Well, let me go under operators here.

1063
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,860
中文字幕
Multiplication sounds like it could get us places quicker.

1064
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:27,260
中文字幕
And let me go ahead and go to variables.

1065
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:29,830
中文字幕
And instead of changing the counter by one,

1066
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:32,290
中文字幕
let me go ahead and just keep setting it to something else.

1067
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,530
中文字幕
So let me drag and drop this.

1068
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:38,360
中文字幕
Set the counter equal to something times something, specifically

1069
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:44,810
中文字幕
the counter times two, thereby doubling, doubling, doubling, doubling.

1070
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:47,250
中文字幕
That would seem to grow, so to speak, a lot faster.

1071
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:49,400
中文字幕
Let's see.

1072
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:54,210
中文字幕
1, 2, 4.

1073
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:56,780
中文字幕
So he's counting faster, but it's still kind of tedious.

1074
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,640
中文字幕
What if we instead do this?

1075
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,660
中文字幕
Let's stop waiting and let's go ahead and, with the looks,

1076
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:06,960
中文字幕
not say counter for one second, but let's just quickly say counter.

1077
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,300
中文字幕
So I'm going to say the counter.

1078
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,290
中文字幕
Whoops.

1079
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:13,460
中文字幕
I'm going to say the counter and then I'm going to set it to itself times 2.

1080
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,560
中文字幕
So here's where we're at.

1081
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,950
中文字幕
Initialize, or set the counter to 1 initially, say it, then double it,

1082
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:21,930
中文字幕
then double it, then double it, saying it along the way.

1083
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:23,690
中文字幕
So here we go.

1084
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:26,720
中文字幕
That's impressive.

1085
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:32,320
中文字幕
So now the sheep has counted up to 10 to the 60th so far.

1086
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,160
中文字幕
10 to the 100th.

1087
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:34,660
中文字幕
OK.

1088
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:39,370
中文字幕
Now, it doesn't even fit in the speech bubble, but he's still going.

1089
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:41,380
中文字幕
How high can he go?

1090
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:45,970
中文字幕
What's the biggest number you can count to in a computer?

1091
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:49,410
中文字幕
Anyone want to guess?

1092
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:51,400
中文字幕
Could be here a while.

1093
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,130
中文字幕
10 to the 270th now.

1094
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:57,530
中文字幕
How high can you count, or rather--

1095
00:47:57,530 --> 00:47:58,030
中文字幕
OK.

1096
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:01,010
中文字幕
So we gave up and just called it infinity.

1097
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:03,340
中文字幕
So it turns out infinity does have a precise value--

1098
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,680
中文字幕
10 to the 250th or so.

1099
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,150
中文字幕
But what happens here?

1100
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:09,490
中文字幕
Well, because computers, at the end of the day,

1101
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:12,700
中文字幕
are just storing information digitally-- but that information digitally has

1102
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:15,640
中文字幕
to be physically stored using electricity, using these lower level

1103
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,990
中文字幕
switches called transistors.

1104
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:20,200
中文字幕
At the end of the day, my phone, my laptop, whatever device in question

1105
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,510
中文字幕
only has a finite amount of those things.

1106
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:24,380
中文字幕
I only have a finite number of fingers.

1107
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:26,800
中文字幕
Using unary, my old school hashmark approach,

1108
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,360
中文字幕
I can count to five on this hand.

1109
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:32,380
中文字幕
Using binary, I claimed I could count to 31 on this hand.

1110
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:33,610
中文字幕
But it's still finite.

1111
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:37,270
中文字幕
I cannot count to infinity on this hand because I only have five fingers.

1112
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:40,570
中文字幕
Similarly does a computer only have so many transistors or so

1113
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:43,240
中文字幕
many bytes or bits of memory, and at some point,

1114
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,790
中文字幕
the programmer has to think about what is he

1115
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:48,580
中文字幕
or she going to do when the user wants to count so high that you

1116
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:51,080
中文字幕
can't physically fit it anymore.

1117
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:54,310
中文字幕
You have to give up like this and say something semi accurately

1118
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:57,980
中文字幕
or you have to handle that issue in some other way.

1119
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:01,180
中文字幕
And we'll see when we get to C that how you handle this problem is not

1120
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:03,730
中文字幕
necessarily straightforward, and indeed a lot of software

1121
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:05,610
中文字幕
out there does not handle this problem.

1122
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,660
中文字幕
And odds are, all of us have programs that if you

1123
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:10,180
中文字幕
type big enough words or big enough numbers into them,

1124
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,970
中文字幕
they might very well break or crash or freeze

1125
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:16,600
中文字幕
because the humans, unlike MIT, did not anticipate that that might actually

1126
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:17,890
中文字幕
happen and handle it.

1127
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:19,310
中文字幕
Well, let me go ahead and do this.

1128
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:22,780
中文字幕
Let me open up this program and see if we can't read the code now.

1129
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:28,330
中文字幕
This is called Pet Zero and this is a program that simulates petting.

1130
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:31,630
中文字幕
So if I click play and don't touch the keyboard,

1131
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:35,350
中文字幕
nothing seems to be happening, but if I now move my cursor over to the cat--

1132
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:36,800
中文字幕
[MEOW]

1133
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,770
中文字幕
Aw.

1134
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:38,590
中文字幕
It's kind of cute.

1135
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:39,280
中文字幕
[MEOW]

1136
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,790
中文字幕
Right now, it's more only meowing on demand when you pet the cat.

1137
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:43,480
中文字幕
Why?

1138
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,640
中文字幕
Well, notice I've added some other building blocks.

1139
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,130
中文字幕
We haven't used this one before, but it intuitively

1140
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:49,630
中文字幕
probably makes pretty clear sense.

1141
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:52,660
中文字幕
When the green flag is clicked, forever do the following.

1142
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:56,070
中文字幕
If the cat is touching the mouse pointer-- this thing in blue

1143
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:58,030
中文字幕
is what we called earlier a Boolean expression.

1144
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:00,760
中文字幕
It has a yes/no, a true/false, a one/zero answer.

1145
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,560
中文字幕
And touching mouse pointer is one of the options in the little drop

1146
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,150
中文字幕
down here if you tinker with it.

1147
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:08,290
中文字幕
So if the cat is touching the mouse pointer, then and only then,

1148
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:10,450
中文字幕
play sound meow until done.

1149
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:14,200
中文字幕
So we've combined now functions with loops with a condition.

1150
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,330
中文字幕
But why the loop?

1151
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:19,390
中文字幕
The cat's only meowing once when I pet him.

1152
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:21,580
中文字幕
Why am I doing anything forever here?

1153
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:25,530
中文字幕
Someone-- yeah.

1154
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,100
中文字幕
Yeah.

1155
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,910
中文字幕
I might want to pet it again, so I want the program to anticipate that.

1156
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:36,480
中文字幕
And honestly, if I omitted this forever block and my program

1157
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,130
中文字幕
instead looked just like this--

1158
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:40,890
中文字幕
so let me get rid of that and this--

1159
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:45,780
中文字幕
and then I clicked play, and now, I hover over him,

1160
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,550
中文字幕
why is it not working even once?

1161
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:52,090
中文字幕
Say it again.

1162
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:57,200
中文字幕
Yeah.

1163
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,740
中文字幕
So I mean, at this point, if I can summarize,

1164
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:03,080
中文字幕
the computer is so damn fast that this already

1165
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:07,190
中文字幕
happened by the time I moved my cursor over to the cat, and at the moment

1166
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:10,220
中文字幕
I clicked play, I was not touching the cat.

1167
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,780
中文字幕
Those blocks executed, so to speak, top to bottom.

1168
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:13,970
中文字幕
That's it for the program.

1169
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:16,970
中文字幕
So by the time I move the cursor over to the cat, the program is over.

1170
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:17,760
中文字幕
It's not listening.

1171
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,960
中文字幕
And so forever, this way I can actually listen in perpetuity for something

1172
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,430
中文字幕
to actually happen.

1173
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:26,000
中文字幕
What if I want to do something not just if something is true,

1174
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,300
中文字幕
but handle two cases?

1175
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,340
中文字幕
If or else.

1176
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:31,130
中文字幕
Well, let me go ahead and open up Pet One.

1177
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,870
中文字幕
And this is another example.

1178
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:37,310
中文字幕
And could someone perhaps describe, after reading this code, what

1179
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:38,810
中文字幕
this program is going to do instead?

1180
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:42,790
中文字幕
Yeah.

1181
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:54,300
中文字幕
Exactly.

1182
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,750
中文字幕
And let me summarize more verbally.

1183
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:59,590
中文字幕
So if this time, you're touching the cat, it's going to roar instead.

1184
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:01,950
中文字幕
Else, it's just going to meow sweetly.

1185
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:05,830
中文字幕
So this time, it is meowing perpetually once every second,

1186
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:08,850
中文字幕
but if you touch this particular cat, it doesn't like it.

1187
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:09,660
中文字幕
So play.

1188
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,570
中文字幕
[MEOW]

1189
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:11,070
中文字幕
Meow.

1190
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:12,310
中文字幕
[MEOW]

1191
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:13,130
中文字幕
Meow.

1192
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,350
中文字幕
[MEOW]

1193
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:15,360
中文字幕
And now.

1194
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,320
中文字幕
[ROAR]

1195
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,640
中文字幕
Don't touch the cat.

1196
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,160
中文字幕
So now, we might interact in two different ways

1197
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,970
中文字幕
by having two different roads that you can go down.

1198
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:25,560
中文字幕
Well, let's actually make something a little more interactive.

1199
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,730
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and open another example.

1200
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:29,850
中文字幕
This one's called Bounce Zero because now, we

1201
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:33,690
中文字幕
can start to see some design elements from what Oscar Time was.

1202
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:36,360
中文字幕
Like this now it's getting a little interesting.

1203
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,350
中文字幕
What is actually going on here?

1204
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:40,470
中文字幕
So let me zoom in on the blocks here.

1205
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:43,980
中文字幕
This block is just saying forever move 10 steps, which

1206
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,360
中文字幕
is another block we haven't seen.

1207
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,920
中文字幕
But 10 steps is like 10 pixels.

1208
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,930
中文字幕
So move 10 pixels on the screen.

1209
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:52,330
中文字幕
But if you're touching the edge, then turn around 180 degrees.

1210
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:54,200
中文字幕
And you can see exactly that happening.

1211
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,540
中文字幕
Scratch is turning around 180 degrees and this rotation style just

1212
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,320
中文字幕
means double back.

1213
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,810
中文字幕
Don't like loop around 180 degrees.

1214
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,020
中文字幕
So that's kind of cool.

1215
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:05,100
中文字幕
But this is not how humans or cats walk.

1216
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:10,340
中文字幕
Like what is obviously unnatural about this?

1217
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:10,840
中文字幕
Yeah.

1218
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,840
中文字幕
I mean, I mean, I can't even simulate it, right?

1219
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,580
中文字幕
Like his feet are in static position, yet sliding back and forth

1220
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:16,540
中文字幕
on the screen.

1221
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:18,160
中文字幕
And yet, that is not what walking is.

1222
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,950
中文字幕
Like walking presumably has some kind of movement and what?

1223
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:22,870
中文字幕
Well, we could just kind of simulate it like--

1224
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:24,190
中文字幕
OK, I could just walk--

1225
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:28,420
中文字幕
walking and you can imagine taking like really quick photographs of my legs

1226
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:31,450
中文字幕
or the cat's leg moving and then just deciding this photo

1227
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:33,400
中文字幕
will be representative of one step.

1228
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,530
中文字幕
This photo will be representative another.

1229
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:37,810
中文字幕
And you know, with just two of those steps,

1230
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:41,320
中文字幕
I'd wager we could actually do a pretty good job of simulating

1231
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,620
中文字幕
what walking looks like.

1232
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:46,210
中文字幕
In fact, if I go back to where we began, this picture of Scratch,

1233
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:51,040
中文字幕
what if I just move his legs ever so slightly, then go back,

1234
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,280
中文字幕
then go forward?

1235
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:56,050
中文字幕
And even just in my PDF, I can simulate animation by hitting up arrow,

1236
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:58,670
中文字幕
down arrow, up arrow, down arrow because it kind of

1237
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:01,720
中文字幕
looks like he's walking now, when really, your human eyes are just seeing

1238
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:04,250
中文字幕
two different pictures again and again.

1239
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:05,340
中文字幕
So how can I do this?

1240
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:08,350
中文字幕
Well, if I go back to Scratch, he's still walking.

1241
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:15,500
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and open up Bounce One, the second version of this, and now,

1242
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,300
中文字幕
do this.

1243
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,630
中文字幕
OK.

1244
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,570
中文字幕
So how did I add this?

1245
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:21,870
中文字幕
There's a little purple block that we haven't seen yet,

1246
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:23,740
中文字幕
but if you poke around the categories, you'll

1247
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:26,070
中文字幕
see other blocks like this next costume that just keeps

1248
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:28,230
中文字幕
changing the costume that he's wearing.

1249
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:31,860
中文字幕
It turns out Scratch exists as a picture and his default picture

1250
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:35,760
中文字幕
is him not moving, but if I go up here to top left and click costumes,

1251
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,220
中文字幕
you can actually see that here's his one costume.

1252
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:39,960
中文字幕
Here's his second costume.

1253
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,140
中文字幕
And so that purple block that says next costume, because it's

1254
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:47,460
中文字幕
in the forever loop, it just keeps doing next, next, next, next, next, just

1255
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,240
中文字幕
showing one costume or the other.

1256
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:52,210
中文字幕
They're clearly mimicking walking.

1257
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:53,640
中文字幕
Now, this is not very unnatural.

1258
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:59,040
中文字幕
Why don't we slow him down to, say, five steps at a time and have him go again?

1259
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,660
中文字幕
Now, this is still going pretty fast.

1260
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:03,240
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and say--

1261
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,010
中文字幕
we could have control.

1262
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:11,100
中文字幕
We could have him wait a second after moving very dramatically.

1263
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,550
中文字幕
We could probably speed this up.

1264
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:15,540
中文字幕
So let's wait 1/10 of a second, 0.1.

1265
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:18,650
中文字幕
Or maybe let's do 0.01, 1/100 of a second.

1266
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:20,400
中文字幕
Now, it's getting a little more realistic.

1267
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,810
中文字幕
But this is what animation is.

1268
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:25,510
中文字幕
If you've ever watched a cartoon or a movie based on pictures like this,

1269
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:28,530
中文字幕
you're just tinkering with some of these parameters, these inputs,

1270
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:30,780
中文字幕
in order to produce this output by understanding

1271
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:34,260
中文字幕
what the fundamental representation of these things is, which in this case

1272
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:37,200
中文字幕
are just pictures, again and again and again in order

1273
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,700
中文字幕
to create that animation.

1274
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,400
中文字幕
But what about interactivity?

1275
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,490
中文字幕
Let me do this one myself.

1276
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:45,960
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and get rid of this, go back to events, and say,

1277
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,670
中文字幕
when green flag clicked.

1278
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:50,250
中文字幕
Then, let me go ahead and grab a forever block

1279
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:52,230
中文字幕
so that this keeps going again and again.

1280
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:54,150
中文字幕
And then, let me go ahead to go to motion.

1281
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:57,270
中文字幕
It turns out that under motion, there's this block we haven't seen--

1282
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:59,340
中文字幕
point towards the mouse pointer.

1283
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:01,650
中文字幕
And let me go ahead and pull this in here.

1284
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:06,480
中文字幕
And then, let me have it move just like one step at a time, instead of 10.

1285
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,560
中文字幕
What is this going to do?

1286
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:12,490
中文字幕
What's this program do?

1287
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:12,990
中文字幕
Yeah.

1288
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:14,370
中文字幕
Say it again.

1289
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,280
中文字幕
Follow the mouse.

1290
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:15,780
中文字幕
Yeah.

1291
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:20,580
中文字幕
This is kind of like a way of taking your cat for a walk.

1292
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:24,930
中文字幕
Perhaps not quite the animal we intended, but he'll follow the cursor.

1293
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:27,170
中文字幕
And I can actually speed this up a little bit.

1294
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:28,780
中文字幕
So let's have him move 10 steps.

1295
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:29,280
中文字幕
OK.

1296
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,020
中文字幕
Now, there we go.

1297
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:34,960
中文字幕
So now, he's moving up and down, and so now, it's interactive.

1298
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,650
中文字幕
So you might recall that when we were playing Oscar Time earlier and picking

1299
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:39,150
中文字幕
up--

1300
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:40,530
中文字幕
OK.

1301
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:41,110
中文字幕
Don't do that.

1302
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:42,870
中文字幕
See, that's a bug.

1303
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:43,710
中文字幕
He's just confused.

1304
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:45,660
中文字幕
He's constantly moving toward it, but you're already--

1305
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:45,940
中文字幕
OK.

1306
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:46,930
中文字幕
So we're going to stop.

1307
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:47,430
中文字幕
OK.

1308
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:50,610
中文字幕
So now, he's following, but that's how we might now create,

1309
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:52,980
中文字幕
for instance, the ability to move those pieces of trash

1310
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,950
中文字幕
around and have them follow the mouse cursor.

1311
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:58,070
中文字幕
If you think back to Oscar Time, every time you picked up a piece of trash,

1312
00:56:58,070 --> 00:57:01,320
中文字幕
he'd follow the cursor because there was a forever loop and a block like this

1313
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,180
中文字幕
pointing toward the mouse pointer.

1314
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:05,760
中文字幕
Well, now, let's integrate multiple ideas

1315
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,590
中文字幕
and actually have multiple scripts.

1316
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:12,240
中文字幕
I proposed earlier that programs can actually have multiple threads.

1317
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,780
中文字幕
A thread is just a fancy way of saying, in our context, multiple scripts.

1318
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:21,120
中文字幕
Multiple scripts in one program that are happening essentially in parallel.

1319
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:24,570
中文字幕
A computer can effectively do multiple things at a time thanks to threading,

1320
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:26,010
中文字幕
and more on that down the road.

1321
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:27,720
中文字幕
So these are more involved, but let's see

1322
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,120
中文字幕
if we can-- let's understand first what this program does.

1323
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,320
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and hit play.

1324
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,950
中文字幕
And this one tends to be a little loud.

1325
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:37,180
中文字幕
[SEA LION BARKING]

1326
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:42,800
中文字幕
So the sea lion is just barking endlessly, annoyingly.

1327
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:48,650
中文字幕
So by reading the code, how can I stop him from barking?

1328
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:49,890
中文字幕
Hit the spacebar.

1329
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:50,390
中文字幕
All right.

1330
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:52,770
中文字幕
So hit the spacebar.

1331
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:53,750
中文字幕
OK.

1332
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:55,700
中文字幕
I could just stop the program, obviously,

1333
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:57,800
中文字幕
but this program is still running, technically.

1334
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,270
中文字幕
But why did that work?

1335
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:02,300
中文字幕
Well, notice this on the left hand side is the first script.

1336
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:06,370
中文字幕
When the green flag is clicked, set this variable that I called muted to false.

1337
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:08,960
中文字幕
Could have called it x or y or z or counter, but none of those

1338
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,620
中文字幕
really make sense, so I called it muted.

1339
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:13,400
中文字幕
And I set it equal to false, which is, again, a Boolean value.

1340
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,170
中文字幕
True or false just mean yes or no.

1341
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:19,920
中文字幕
Forever, if the keyspace is pressed, then do this.

1342
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,200
中文字幕
If muted is currently false, then change muted to true.

1343
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,670
中文字幕
Else, change muted to false.

1344
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:29,510
中文字幕
So if muted is false, change it to true.

1345
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:31,840
中文字幕
If muted is true, change it to false.

1346
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:35,910
中文字幕
Any time the human hits the spacebar, update that variable.

1347
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:39,500
中文字幕
Now, if we look at the other script, which is also driving the sea lion,

1348
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:40,530
中文字幕
what is he doing?

1349
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:43,580
中文字幕
Forever, if muted is false.

1350
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:44,750
中文字幕
So if he's not muted.

1351
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:46,820
中文字幕
If muted is false means not muted.

1352
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:50,360
中文字幕
Start the sound sea lion and then think hi, hi, hi for two seconds,

1353
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,160
中文字幕
and then wait for one more second.

1354
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,900
中文字幕
And then just repeat, repeat, repeat.

1355
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:56,750
中文字幕
But if I change with the spacebar muted to true,

1356
00:58:56,750 --> 00:59:00,230
中文字幕
he's going to say if muted equals false, that's not so.

1357
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:01,950
中文字幕
I'm not going to play a sound this time.

1358
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:05,360
中文字幕
And so now, we have the ability to integrate multiple scripts together

1359
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,390
中文字幕
in order to achieve a more interactive result.

1360
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:09,670
中文字幕
And what about this?

1361
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:15,560
中文字幕
Back when I was a kid, might have played in the summers Marco Polo.

1362
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:16,650
中文字幕
Super simple game.

1363
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:18,650
中文字幕
We played it in the pool, for some reason, where

1364
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:20,840
中文字幕
one person in the pool very safely is blindfolded,

1365
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,550
中文字幕
and then he or she yells Marco.

1366
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:25,550
中文字幕
And then, everyone around him or her is supposed to yell polo.

1367
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:27,260
中文字幕
And then, the person who's blindfolded is

1368
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:29,540
中文字幕
supposed to go chase the other kids in the pool and tag them,

1369
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:30,650
中文字幕
and then they become it.

1370
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,020
中文字幕
But in other words, it's this like signaling mechanism.

1371
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:35,750
中文字幕
Someone yells, Marco and everyone else responds

1372
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:38,180
中文字幕
to that broadcast of the word Marco.

1373
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:40,910
中文字幕
Well, it turns out we can simulate this with these two puppets.

1374
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:43,550
中文字幕
This guy here-- notice that I've highlighted the orange puppet

1375
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:45,350
中文字幕
because there's a second blue puppet there.

1376
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:46,220
中文字幕
Separate sprites.

1377
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:49,490
中文字幕
And these are just photographs we uploaded to the game.

1378
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:53,780
中文字幕
Forever, if the key space is pressed, so if the spacebar is pressed,

1379
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:57,290
中文字幕
say Marco for two seconds and then broadcast an event.

1380
00:59:57,290 --> 01:00:02,350
中文字幕
Meanwhile, the blue puppet here has a super simple block,

1381
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:04,770
中文字幕
but it's fundamentally different from the ones we've seen.

1382
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:07,580
中文字幕
He's not starting when the green flag is clicked.

1383
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:10,730
中文字幕
He is starting only when he receives an event.

1384
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:13,470
中文字幕
So it turns out that sprites and Scratch can't hear or see

1385
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:15,680
中文字幕
what the other one is saying in those speech bubbles.

1386
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,420
中文字幕
You have to use a fancier technique, which

1387
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:19,430
中文字幕
is the special block called broadcast, which

1388
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:23,390
中文字幕
is like passing a note digitally from one sprite to another

1389
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:26,210
中文字幕
that the other one can read or receive, so to speak.

1390
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:28,430
中文字幕
So only when he receives this event, so to speak,

1391
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:30,800
中文字幕
does he say polo for two seconds.

1392
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:34,350
中文字幕
And again, the orange puppet sends that secret message

1393
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:35,810
中文字幕
just using this other puzzle piece.

1394
01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:40,530
中文字幕
Broadcast an event, like passing a note that the human doesn't actually see.

1395
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:45,410
中文字幕
So if I now hit the green flag and hit the spacebar, orange yells Marco.

1396
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:48,380
中文字幕
Blue guy yells polo in response.

1397
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,270
中文字幕
But those aren't timed together.

1398
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:53,690
中文字幕
Rather, the blue guy is hearing with the orange one has said,

1399
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:58,740
中文字幕
thereby allowing multiple sprites to actually intercommunicate.

1400
01:00:58,740 --> 01:00:59,780
中文字幕
So how did we get here?

1401
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:02,930
中文字幕
Well, recall that we had all of these building blocks a moment ago.

1402
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:05,270
中文字幕
First, we started out with just functions and conditions

1403
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:06,710
中文字幕
and Boolean expressions and loops.

1404
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:09,040
中文字幕
We've now added to that the ability to store information

1405
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,530
中文字幕
in variables and threads to do multiple things at once, and then, if you do

1406
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:14,840
中文字幕
have multiple things happening, events, where

1407
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,180
中文字幕
they can enter communicate somehow.

1408
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:18,530
中文字幕
Yet another building block.

1409
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:21,620
中文字幕
So if we now take a step back and consider

1410
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:26,360
中文字幕
how we can make functions of our own, we have the final piece

1411
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,890
中文字幕
of the puzzle, so to speak.

1412
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:29,090
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and do this.

1413
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:33,500
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and create a simple program with, when green flag clipped,

1414
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,570
中文字幕
that simply simulates coughing for a cat.

1415
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:40,760
中文字幕
So this cat is going to say not hello, but cough for one second.

1416
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:44,540
中文字幕
And then he's going to go ahead and wait for one second.

1417
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:48,200
中文字幕
And then I'm going to go ahead and copy paste, as I did before--

1418
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:52,040
中文字幕
this is one of those do as I say, not as I do-- to implement this program here,

1419
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,170
中文字幕
where he coughs three times.

1420
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:57,020
中文字幕
We already know, though, from earlier that this is not good design.

1421
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:59,430
中文字幕
Why?

1422
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:00,520
中文字幕
You're repeating yourself.

1423
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,080
中文字幕
Don't repeat yourself.

1424
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,570
中文字幕
DRY is an acronym, actually.

1425
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:05,320
中文字幕
Don't repeat yourself because you're doing

1426
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:09,340
中文字幕
three times as many times something that you only really need to do once.

1427
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:12,680
中文字幕
The solution before, of course, was just use a loop of some sort.

1428
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:14,230
中文字幕
So let me actually take that out.

1429
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:18,130
中文字幕
Let me use a repeat block, change 10 to three,

1430
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:19,810
中文字幕
and then just use two of these blocks.

1431
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:22,150
中文字幕
And notice already, the program is so much more compact.

1432
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:27,040
中文字幕
And now, if I want to change the three to a 30 or to a 10 or any number,

1433
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:28,550
中文字幕
I just change one simple value.

1434
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:31,840
中文字幕
I don't have to rewrite or copy paste or delete things.

1435
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,820
中文字幕
I can update the program much more readily,

1436
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:39,370
中文字幕
and now, the same thing is going to happen with just cough, cough, cough.

1437
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:43,010
中文字幕
But it turns out that it would be nice to henceforth abstract away from this,

1438
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:43,510
中文字幕
right?

1439
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:46,960
中文字幕
I just want any program I write to know how to cough.

1440
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,210
中文字幕
And coughing is really just saying something, perhaps

1441
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:50,540
中文字幕
some number of times.

1442
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:53,110
中文字幕
But it turns out we can abstract this away in code.

1443
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:55,930
中文字幕
Let me go down to my blocks here and this allows

1444
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:57,710
中文字幕
me to click this button-- make a block.

1445
01:02:57,710 --> 01:02:59,440
中文字幕
It allows me to make my own function.

1446
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,120
中文字幕
I get this dialog window here.

1447
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,850
中文字幕
And I'm just going to call this block cough.

1448
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:05,870
中文字幕
I'm going to go ahead and click OK.

1449
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:09,420
中文字幕
And now, I have this new pink block that itself can have blocks underneath it.

1450
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:10,840
中文字幕
And you know what I'm going to do?

1451
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,410
中文字幕
I'm going to go ahead and do this.

1452
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:16,570
中文字幕
I'm going to go ahead and say cough under there.

1453
01:03:16,570 --> 01:03:20,260
中文字幕
And now, notice on the left, I now have access to this new pink piece.

1454
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:22,220
中文字幕
I can now put this in here.

1455
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:26,470
中文字幕
So now, notice even though, yes, this is how coughing is implemented

1456
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:30,320
中文字幕
on the left hand side here, next time, when I write a program,

1457
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,960
中文字幕
I just want to call cough.

1458
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:34,630
中文字幕
And I don't care about those lower level implementation details.

1459
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:36,460
中文字幕
I don't care about the party or any of that.

1460
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:38,230
中文字幕
I just want this to be an abstraction.

1461
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:40,510
中文字幕
But I could do better than this wouldn't it

1462
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:43,730
中文字幕
be nice if instead of just repeating cough three times,

1463
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:45,670
中文字幕
what if I made that a feature of cough?

1464
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:46,760
中文字幕
So let me do this.

1465
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:51,010
中文字幕
I can go ahead and right click on this pink piece and I can edit it.

1466
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:52,990
中文字幕
That brings up that same window from before.

1467
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:53,710
中文字幕
And notice this.

1468
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:55,070
中文字幕
Add an input.

1469
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:58,210
中文字幕
So when I make a custom block, I can actually make pretty fancy blocks

1470
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:01,570
中文字幕
just like the ones MIT gives us with the software,

1471
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:03,700
中文字幕
and now, I can type in something like n.

1472
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:07,060
中文字幕
And if I add a label just to make it more descriptive, I can just say times.

1473
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:09,040
中文字幕
So now, I've made a special custom puzzle

1474
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:12,880
中文字幕
piece that says cough some number of times, where n for number

1475
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,340
中文字幕
is just the go to variable that programmers tend to use.

1476
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:24,260
中文字幕
So now, I can actually move this repeat block into cough itself,

1477
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,290
中文字幕
but rather than hard code 3, notice this.

1478
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:31,360
中文字幕
I can steal that variable and now say cough this many times by repeating

1479
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:34,630
中文字幕
saying this again and again and again.

1480
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:39,880
中文字幕
And now, when I cough in my actual program, I just type in three here.

1481
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:42,350
中文字幕
So I have this beautiful abstraction now, so to speak.

1482
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:45,490
中文字幕
Cough this many times and I and no one else in the world

1483
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:48,730
中文字幕
never again needs to care about what it means to cough because we've already

1484
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:50,330
中文字幕
implemented that before.

1485
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:52,810
中文字幕
And so just as MIT has given us so much functionality

1486
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:54,940
中文字幕
that we ourselves don't have to think about, so can

1487
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:57,560
中文字幕
I now make functionality that I don't have to think about.

1488
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,340
中文字幕
And as we progress to higher level languages like C and JavaScript

1489
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:02,800
中文字幕
and Python, we're going to continue this process, sometimes

1490
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:06,460
中文字幕
solving problems ourselves by making our own custom puzzle pieces,

1491
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:08,620
中文字幕
but very often using things called libraries,

1492
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:13,060
中文字幕
code that other humans wrote before us that's just useful to get the job done,

1493
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:16,970
中文字幕
just as Scratch has done here in part for us.

1494
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:19,360
中文字幕
Let me go ahead, then, and bring all of this

1495
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:23,750
中文字幕
together by opening this other example here.

1496
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:27,470
中文字幕
Let me go ahead and open up this one, which isn't something we've seen,

1497
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:31,330
中文字幕
but it's kind of an interactive game like this made by a former student.

1498
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:35,540
中文字幕
[MUSIC PLAYING]

1499
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:36,790
中文字幕
Should we have an apple?

1500
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:38,840
中文字幕
Yes.

1501
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,240
中文字幕
A little animation.

1502
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:44,920
中文字幕
OK.

1503
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:46,720
中文字幕
That didn't end well.

1504
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:47,770
中文字幕
Let's try again.

1505
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:49,660
中文字幕
Play again.

1506
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:51,960
中文字幕
And notice the say block is happening.

1507
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,250
中文字幕
There's some kind of ask block.

1508
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,730
中文字幕
The student was checking if the human typed in yes or no.

1509
01:05:56,730 --> 01:05:57,730
中文字幕
Let's type no this time.

1510
01:05:57,730 --> 01:05:58,600
中文字幕
No apple.

1511
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,100
中文字幕
Ooh.

1512
01:05:59,100 --> 01:05:59,740
中文字幕
Cupcake.

1513
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:00,240
中文字幕
OK.

1514
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:00,890
中文字幕
Yes.

1515
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:01,390
中文字幕
Enter.

1516
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:08,030
中文字幕
OK.

1517
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:09,660
中文字幕
Don't do that.

1518
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:10,380
中文字幕
One more life.

1519
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:10,880
中文字幕
Here we go.

1520
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:13,700
中文字幕
OK.

1521
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:15,590
中文字幕
No apple.

1522
01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:16,160
中文字幕
No cupcake.

1523
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:21,660
中文字幕
Little variable.

1524
01:06:28,970 --> 01:06:29,470
中文字幕
OK.

1525
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:32,620
中文字幕
So I won the game.

1526
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:37,780
中文字幕
In our final moments here, let me go ahead and open one final example.

1527
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:41,760
中文字幕
As you know, CS50 is offered not only at Harvard, but at Yale, as well,

1528
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,810
中文字幕
so it seems fitting to perhaps end on a note that

1529
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:47,320
中文字幕
pits one campus perhaps against the other by way of another game

1530
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:50,110
中文字幕
that a former student wrote called Ivy's Hardest Game.

1531
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:53,450
中文字幕
But for this, I think we need one final volunteer who's company coming up.

1532
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:53,950
中文字幕
OK.

1533
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:54,590
中文字幕
First hand.

1534
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:55,090
中文字幕
Right there.

1535
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:56,920
中文字幕
Come on down.

1536
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:00,140
中文字幕
